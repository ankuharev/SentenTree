1	No.	58
2	Dr.	26
3	Yeah.	26
4	What?	20
5	Okay.	17
6	Sorry.	17
7	House.	14
8	Yes.	14
9	Thank you.	13
10	Fine.	13
11	I'm sorry.	13
12	Why?	12
13	I don't know.	11
14	I know.	11
15	Hey.	10
16	So.	9
17	You're right.	9
18	Uh.	7
19	Wait.	7
20	It's okay.	7
21	I just.	7
22	But.	7
23	Come on.	7
24	Cool.	6
25	I have no idea.	6
26	Hi.	6
27	Mm-Hmm.	6
28	I.	6
29	I'm fine.	6
30	Oh.	6
31	Nothing.	6
32	Okay?	5
33	Oh, my God.	5
34	Sure.	5
35	Really?	5
36	Shut up.	5
37	House?	5
38	Good.	5
39	Great.	5
40	C.	5
41	Admit it.	5
42	Ah.	5
43	Adams.	5
44	What is it?	5
45	What are you doing?	5
46	Um.	5
47	Thanks.	5
48	There she is.	4
49	There.	4
50	Well.	4
51	All right.	4
52	D.	4
53	Congratulations.	4
54	Damn it.	4
55	Everybody lies.	4
56	Don't.	4
57	Huh.	4
58	Right.	4
59	S.	4
60	See?	4
61	R.	4
62	Seriously?	4
63	Oh, no.	4
64	Interesting.	4
65	I'm so sorry.	3
66	It's unlikely.	3
67	I'll do it.	3
68	I'll take Taub.	3
69	I was wrong.	3
70	now.	3
71	Ohh.	3
72	O.	3
73	Park.	3
74	Nope.	3
75	Mm.	3
76	My wife.	3
77	Please continue.	3
78	Please.	3
79	Hey, House.	3
80	I can't.	3
81	Excuse me?	3
82	Foreman.	3
83	Go.	3
84	Here.	3
85	Good point.	3
86	Got it.	3
87	Come in.	3
88	Absolutely.	3
89	And.	3
90	What's happening?	3
91	What's he saying?	3
92	What explosion?	3
93	What were you thinking?	3
94	Where?	3
95	Where are you going?	3
96	Stop.	3
97	You're off the case.	3
98	You're an ass.	3
99	Wow.	3
100	Wills to recovery.	2
101	You win.	2
102	You're an idiot.	2
103	You're fine.	2
104	You're fired.	2
105	You were right.	2
106	What's the matter?	2
107	You're late.	2
108	I, um.	2
109	You're lying.	2
110	You're wrong.	2
111	T.	2
112	Take him out.	2
113	The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.	2
114	Unique situation.	2
115	U.	2
116	Three.	2
117	The patient.	2
118	That's ridiculous.	2
119	When?	2
120	What's wrong with me?	2
121	Why are you here?	2
122	Why is she here?	2
123	Vascular clamp.	2
124	What happened?	2
125	Well?	2
126	Well done.	2
127	Wait a minute.	2
128	What did he say?	2
129	Uh-huh.	2
130	Unless.	2
131	Up high.	2
132	Vasospasm.	2
133	Well, I think we've heard enough.	2
134	We're in the hospital.	2
135	Andres.	2
136	Barraco azul.	2
137	Bad idea.	2
138	Already did.	2
139	Andrews.	2
140	Barton?	2
141	Because.	2
142	Biopsy was clean.	2
143	And then what happened?	2
144	And then what?	2
145	Are you okay?	2
146	?	2
147	20?	2
148	Am I boring you?	2
149	Better.	2
150	Can you hear me?	2
151	Could be genetic.	2
152	Don't tell me.	2
153	Dr.Chase.	2
154	E.	2
155	Chase.	2
156	Chase?	2
157	Cankles.	2
158	Boring.	2
159	Get your hands off me.	2
160	He's not wrong.	2
161	Give her the file.	2
162	G.	2
163	He smacked his head against the wall.	2
164	Don't worry.	2
165	Exactly.	2
166	Eric.	2
167	I agree.	2
168	I didn't tell him.	2
169	Here I am.	2
170	I am so sorry.	2
171	How did you know?	2
172	I don't understand.	2
173	I promise.	2
174	I did.	2
175	How'd you know?	2
176	I don't think so.	2
177	I don't.	2
178	I gotta go.	2
179	I have to go.	2
180	P.	2
181	Ouch.	2
182	Ready?	2
183	Relax.	2
184	See you tomorrow.	2
185	Something like that.	2
186	Spy.	2
187	Sometimes.	2
188	Take your time.	2
189	So he just walked out?	2
190	So am I.	2
191	So who do you blame, Dr.	2
192	Like what?	2
193	Morning.	2
194	No, no.	2
195	Myelodysplastic syndrome.	2
196	Not really.	2
197	Not anymore.	2
198	Me sinto quente.	2
199	Mr.	2
200	My chest.	2
201	Nice.	2
202	One, two, three.	2
203	On the other hand.	2
204	No, you won't.	2
205	Nurse Williams to social services.	2
206	Oh, shut up.	2
207	I thought so.	2
208	I should go.	2
209	I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.	2
210	If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.	2
211	I'll be back.	2
212	I'm betting on the last one.	2
213	I was at a job interview.	2
214	It fits.	2
215	Just knowing you're there for me is enough.	2
216	L.	2
217	Make a wish.	2
218	Look it up.	2
219	Kawas.	2
220	Like, forever?	2
221	I got to get out of here.	2
222	K.	2
223	m.	2
224	It's not real.	2
225	Is everything okay?	2
226	Is that bad?	2
227	I'm thirsty.	2
228	It's a possibility.	2
229	It's a press release.	1
230	It's a prop.	1
231	It's a simple test.	1
232	It's a slow-growing tumor.	1
233	It's a small world.	1
234	It's a stupid idea.	1
235	It's a symptom.	1
236	It's a synthetic problem.	1
237	It's a tale as old as time.	1
238	It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss.	1
239	It's a tough thing to control.	1
240	It's a valid sexual orientation.	1
241	It's a very expensive machine, and I'd like it back.	1
242	It's above normal.	1
243	It's actually not such a big deal.	1
244	It's actually pretty fun.	1
245	It's all about common ground.	1
246	It's all bought and paid for.	1
247	It's all her fault.	1
248	It's all moot.	1
249	It's all of you.	1
250	It's already too long.	1
251	It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask brutally enough.	1
252	It's an imperfect world.	1
253	It's at my stepdad's law office.	1
254	It's autoimmune.	1
255	It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.	1
256	It's been a family business for 120 years.	1
257	It's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.	1
258	It's been a year.	1
259	It's been earned.	1
260	It's been hard for him-- living in their house, driving down the same streets.	1
261	It's been mildly elevated.	1
262	It's been years since he died.	1
263	It's better to think the man's dead but decent.	1
264	It's brighter in the morning.	1
265	It's Burkitt's.	1
266	It's called Alice in Wonderland syndrome.	1
267	It's called respect.	1
268	It's called syphilis.	1
269	It's called tumor lysis syndrome.	1
270	It's cancer.	1
271	It's clear you're back working for House.	1
272	It's clotted up.	1
273	It's consistent with all of her symptoms.	1
274	It's cute.	1
275	It's different for girls.	1
276	It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin.	1
277	It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.	1
278	it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right.	1
279	It's even crazier than the gift thing.	1
280	It's extreme and reckless.	1
281	It's failing.	1
282	It's for his own good.	1
283	It's for me.	1
284	It's for the best.	1
285	It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.	1
286	It's getting hard to see.	1
287	It's going to be okay, baby.	1
288	It's gone.	1
289	It's good for a couple to share a hobby.	1
290	It's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.	1
291	It's got 106 leds, each one sending light to your eyes, slightly different wavelength.	1
292	It's got to be a clot keeping her from bleeding out.	1
293	It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus.	1
294	It's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.	1
295	It's great to be back among friends.	1
296	It's happened to me a few times.	1
297	It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor.	1
298	It's healing itself.	1
299	It's helpful for society if its members have positive feelings about that society.	1
300	It's her choice.	1
301	It's his heart we're worried about.	1
302	It's his heart.	1
303	It's his liver.	1
304	It's his lymph nodes.	1
305	It's his risk to take.	1
306	It's in my genes.	1
307	It's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who deserves it.	1
308	It's inside.	1
309	It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to judge the new one.	1
310	It's interesting.	1
311	It's just a benign fat deposit.	1
312	It's just a stupid way to make a living.	1
313	It's just good to hear your voice.	1
314	It's just me telling him he can get away with anything.	1
315	It's just really hard doing this by myself.	1
316	It's just you have to go.	1
317	It's just.	1
318	It's Kawasaki's Disease.	1
319	It's less dangerous than where you're headed.	1
320	It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.	1
321	It's like I said.	1
322	It's like it wasn't even me.	1
323	It's like Satan's alarm clock.	1
324	It's like we're twins.	1
325	It's like you getting two women pregnant at the same time.	1
326	It's like.	1
327	It's linked to type A personalities.	1
328	It's lupus.	1
329	It's mastocytosis.	1
330	It's me time.	1
331	It's med-speak for she's an idiot.	1
332	It's Milton.	1
333	It's mine.	1
334	It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values to determine who gets raises, vacation time, and my respect.	1
335	it's my fault.	1
336	It's my job description.	1
337	It's my parents.	1
338	It's neurological.	1
339	It's never actually been used before.	1
340	It's no longer my choice.	1
341	It's none of my business.	1
342	it's normal pressure hydrocephalus.	1
343	It's normal to be screwed up.	1
344	It's not a clot.	1
345	It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.	1
346	It's not a scam.	1
347	It's not all about you.	1
348	It's not an admission of guilt.	1
349	It's not an infection.	1
350	It's not angina.	1
351	It's not anxiety.	1
352	It's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right?	1
353	It's not bad for a day's work.	1
354	It's not bad.	1
355	It's not cocaine.	1
356	It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.	1
357	It's not diagnostically relevant.	1
358	It's not endocarditis.	1
359	It's not even clear if our patient just had a heart attack or what it was.	1
360	It's not gonorrhea.	1
361	It's not her brain.	1
362	It's not his heart.	1
363	It's not his liver.	1
364	It's not his spinal cord, it's the wiring between his heart and his brain.	1
365	It's not important.	1
366	It's not in the plans.	1
367	It's not insider trading.	1
368	It's not just me and Park.	1
369	It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.	1
370	It's not like I want to be cut open and have a part of me taken out.	1
371	It's not looking good for Fahr's either.	1
372	It's not lupus.	1
373	It's not meningitis.	1
374	It's not my fault.	1
375	It's not my problem if you go back to prison.	1
376	It's not naive.	1
377	It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.	1
378	It's not possible.	1
379	I'm told that some people are just nice.	1
380	I'm too little.	1
381	I'm totally fine with Taub or Park.	1
382	I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.	1
383	I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced Adams has parentally inflicted damage.	1
384	I'm trying to keep House out of prison.	1
385	I'm trying to survive on one a day for the next few days.	1
386	I'm waiting for some test results.	1
387	I'm Walter Cofield, Chief of Neurology, Mercy Hospital.	1
388	I'm Walter Cofield.	1
389	I'm working! How much?	1
390	I'm wrong all the time.	1
391	I'm.	1
392	Imaginary medicine is not my specialty.	1
393	Imagine how sorry I am.	1
394	Imagine what would happen if there was a terrorist attack on the food supply or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.	1
395	Imperio absenti chaos regit.	1
396	Implicitly, you just said that Chase was at fault.	1
397	Impressive.	1
398	In 8 of 12 months time served we have the discretion to grant parole, Friday the 10th, five days from now.	1
399	In a good way?	1
400	In a lake or a pond or an everglade?	1
401	In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.	1
402	In addition to the multiple personalities?	1
403	In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors.	1
404	In fact, he actually called you Stompee, with an ee.	1
405	In fact, I cheated most of you here tonight.	1
406	In fact, I even encourage it.	1
407	In here.	1
408	In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?	1
409	In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's patients regress to old routines.	1
410	In my lungs?	1
411	In my opinion at the time, it was the rash that was gonna kill him.	1
412	In other words, loyalty gave him cancer.	1
413	In Sunday's sports section, New Jersey Devils goaltender Johan Hedberg was.	1
414	In the hospital?	1
415	In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town-- ladling kittens, spaying soup.	1
416	In the middle of a procedure that could basically save your life, House is actually trying to drag people away?	1
417	In the pool is the neighbor's daughter.	1
418	In two months, I came running home.	1
419	In which case, I will be teaching you my secret homey handshake.	1
420	In which case, you cannot take his money.	1
421	Increase peep.	1
422	Increase the steroid dose.	1
423	Increasing to 100% FiO2.	1
424	Infected blood and tissue everywhere you look.	1
425	Infection was right, after all.	1
426	Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.	1
427	Inject the dye.	1
428	Instead of building bunkers, you should be getting boosters.	1
429	Instead, I am going to lose $20,000.	1
430	Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?	1
431	Interesting that you never showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer.	1
432	Interesting, but not relevant.	1
433	Internal neck trauma, that's impressive.	1
434	Invasive strep.	1
435	Iodine contrast.	1
436	Iranian women.	1
437	Iris has always been a moody girl.	1
438	Iris has dissociative identity disorder.	1
439	Iris hasn't had any severe traumas.	1
440	Iris isn't sexually active.	1
441	Iris! How do you know I'm lying?	1
442	Iris.	1
443	Iris?	1
444	Iron.	1
445	Iron?	1
446	Is an ultrasound really necessary?	1
447	Is another one hooking up with 38-year-old married men?	1
448	is brilliant.	1
449	Is endocarditis treatable?	1
450	Is everyone trying to think of an answer?	1
451	Is everything all right?	1
452	I'm staining for excess iron.	1
453	I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.	1
454	I'm still going to my pediatric one.	1
455	I'm still gonna-- Keep less?	1
456	I'm still high in the esophagus.	1
457	I'm still on temporary vows.	1
458	I'm still sending him back.	1
459	I'm sure it would mean a lot to him to see you.	1
460	I'm sure she succeeded.	1
461	I'm sure she understands.	1
462	I'm sure that's true if flag is a euphemism for penis and football is a euphemism for entering a vagina.	1
463	I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh?	1
464	I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.	1
465	I'm talking about your breasts.	1
466	I'm talking to Taub.	1
467	I'm talking to this agent.	1
468	I'm telling the truth.	1
469	I'm the one who did the test.	1
470	I'm thinking brucella.	1
471	I'm thinking occult long QT syndrome?	1
472	I'm thinking of going hang gliding.	1
473	I'm thinking-- you all right?	1
474	is that Foreman?	1
475	Is that fugliness weekly?	1
476	Is that good?	1
477	Is that how little you think of me?	1
478	Is that how our system works?	1
479	Is that it?	1
480	Is that Portuguese?	1
481	Is that real?	1
482	Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?	1
483	Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?	1
484	Is that what he called it?	1
485	Is that why you left?	1
486	Is that why you wanna be a nun?	1
487	Is that your hand near her nether regions?	1
488	Is that, like, a synonym for clever ?	1
489	is the only thing that keeps me here.	1
490	Is the problem hyperammonemic or synthetic?	1
491	Is there any way to take the edge off?	1
492	Is there cake?	1
493	Is there some black market in Insulin that I don't know about?	1
494	Is there some problem with the prescription you gave me?	1
495	Is there someone you want me to call?	1
496	Is this from the alcohol treatment?	1
497	is this really about a woman?	1
498	Is this supposed to itch like this?	1
499	Is this theory more promising than the others?	1
500	Is this true?	1
501	Is, uh, is this because of the medication?	1
502	Ischemic foot.	1
503	Isn't that getting this whole parenting thing ass backwards?	1
504	Isn't that the point of having a spare?	1
505	It ain't there.	1
506	It ain't.	1
507	It amounts to the same thing.	1
508	It automatically slows the car when it senses I'm taking a curve too fast.	1
509	It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.	1
510	It came out of nowhere.	1
511	It can also just be dehydration.	1
512	It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank.	1
513	It can hit any organ.	1
514	It can make you very, very late for very important dates.	1
515	It can wait till you finish your work.	1
516	It could be a bladder infection.	1
517	It could be TB.	1
518	It could destroy his identity.	1
519	It could have been me on the floor.	1
520	It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.	1
521	It definitely started with the great mastectomy of 2001.	1
522	It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.	1
523	It different enough.	1
524	It doesn't make any sense.	1
525	It doesn't seem like much of a case.	1
526	It explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.	1
527	It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, everything.	1
528	it fits all of his symptoms and exains why he got worse after the steroids.	1
529	Is he going to be okay?	1
530	Is he sick because of the explosion?	1
531	Is he tamponading?	1
532	Is he--is he good?	1
533	Is House okay?	1
534	Is it a can opener?	1
535	Is it a dead animal?	1
536	Is it a spatula?	1

538	Is it normal?	1
539	Is it okay for me to walk away from that because I.	1
540	Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?	1
541	Is it safe?	1
542	Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?	1
543	Is it the electrodes?	1
544	Is long QT bad?	1
545	Is my snacking really relevant to this case?	1
546	Is one of you Dr.	1
547	Is she a giant pool of algae?	1
548	Is she okay?	1
549	Is she on the team now?	1
550	is Terrell Owens.	1
551	Is that an issue?	1
552	Is that an ulcer?	1
553	It's not resolved, is it?	1
554	It's not ridiculous.	1
555	It's not stressful.	1
556	It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.	1
557	It's not the cause.	1
558	It's not the guns.	1
559	It's not the place to exorcise your guilt.	1
560	It's not Whipple's.	1
561	It's not working.	1
562	It's not worth living in fear.	1
563	It's not.	1
564	It's nothing I can't handle.	1
565	It's okay, Andres.	1
566	I'm sorry about before.	1
567	I'm sorry about earlier, but we needed to provoke a reaction.	1
568	I'm sorry I led House to you.	1
569	I'm sorry I lied, but-- I know, okay.	1
570	I'm sorry the first time I had both of you together I had to wk.	1
571	I'm sorry, did you say something?	1
572	I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense right now.	1
573	I'm sorry, mommy.	1
574	I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.	1
575	Made a laceration in the left ventricle about the size of the tip of my index finger.	1

606	Kind of like Stockholm syndrome.	1
607	Kind of.	1

613	Kovalchuk had two, Arnott and Parise each had one, and Marty got the shutout.	1
614	Krav Maga.	1
615	Look what happened with London and the riots.	1
616	Look what I found.	1
617	Look, he made a mistake.	1
618	Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.	1
619	Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to achieve.	1
620	Look, my girl's more important.	1
621	Look, the point is I saw this coming.	1
622	Look.	1
623	Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.	1
624	Looks like it.	1
625	Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs.	1
626	Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.	1
627	Looks like we're both wrong.	1
628	Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something.	1
629	Looks like you're gonna need a bigger rationalization.	1
630	Looks like you're ready to go home.	1
631	Looks like you've gone viral, Hon.	1
632	Losing a child-- just breezed right through it.	1

643	Lupus.	1
644	Lying to the patient.	1
645	Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.	1
646	lymphoma.	1
647	Make me lose my job by showing you a patient file?	1
648	Makes me think D.I.C.	1
649	Makes sense.	1
650	makeup, perfume, birth control method, her Hello Kitty doll.	1
651	Making this yet another interaction with you it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.	1

664	Maternity ward.	1
665	May I ask why that matters?	1
666	May I?	1
667	May you what?	1
668	Maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen.	1
669	maybe get suspended and.	1
670	Maybe he found out about her good friend.	1
671	Maybe he got bit by a spider.	1
672	Maybe I should just accept the patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.	1
673	Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.	1
674	Maybe if everybody didn't lie.	1
675	Maybe I'll understand.	1
676	Maybe it won't be so bad.	1
677	Maybe it's not stupidity.	1
678	Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw.	1
679	Maybe it's your character.	1
680	Maybe not as much as this guy, but if people told nothing but the truth, the world would probably burn down overnight.	1
681	Maybe she has cancer.	1
682	Maybe she likes the sound of my voice, which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her.	1
683	Maybe she was opening a present that triggered the reaction.	1
684	Maybe that's selfish.	1
685	Maybe the problem isn't a heavy metal from outside.	1
686	Maybe thrombocytopenia.	1

688	Maybe we could get a meal after work tonight, if you want some companionship.	1
689	Maybe we find you a new hobby, one you're a little better at.	1
690	Maybe we should ask your wife.	1
691	Maybe we should just concentrate on the medicine.	1
692	Maybe we should leave before the police get here.	1
693	Maybe we should look again.	1
694	Maybe we're just out of time.	1
695	Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way.	1

711	Monkey DNA.	1
712	Moo.	1
713	More annoyingly, by having me do it and deal! Of course, you know.	1
714	More clever and you'll always be one step ahead of me.	1
715	More curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?	1
716	More dangerous than complete renal failure?	1
717	More deserving than anyone else?	1
718	More like 13 minutes.	1
719	More likely the patient has a hyperammonemic problem.	1
720	More risk, but more upside.	1
721	more than one person.	1
722	More than one, and you haven't.	1
723	More than that, because you don't have an answer.	1
724	more than they need.	1
725	More to it than you think.	1
726	More truth.	1
727	Morning has broken like the first morning blackbird has spoken like the first bird Nice tie.	1

729	Morning! I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.	1

731	Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and fecal matter, both human and animal.	1
732	Laffont, that's only because we temporarily shut down our Diagnostics Department.	1
733	Larry.	1
734	Last month, I had an incident involving another P.P.T.H. employee.	1

746	Let me down.	1
747	Let me know how it goes.	1
748	Let me see them.	1
749	Let me start with an allegory.	1
750	Let me worry about logistics.	1
751	Let Rodrigo do this.	1
752	Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the events of February 3, 2012 in patient room 209.	1
753	Let them spend five minutes together.	1
754	Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl.	1
755	Let's finish this up.	1
756	Let's get out of here first.	1
757	Let's get out of here.	1
758	Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.	1
759	Let's get the lungs on treatment.	1
760	Let's go through it point by point.	1
761	Let's go! Hey! Wait.	1
762	Let's go.	1
763	Let's hug it out.	1
764	Let's just hope no one cut the wrong wire, eh?	1
765	Let's let it drop.	1
766	Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities.	1
767	Let's release him.	1
768	Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.	1
769	Let's see if this helps.	1
770	Let's try the medication first.	1
771	Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.	1
772	Life with mom and dad was kind of a drag.	1
773	Lighten the anesthesia.	1
774	Lightheadedness?	1
775	Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends to pretend I have a life, when all I did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom, miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.	1
776	Like an ironic thing?	1
777	Like he loves our kids more.	1
778	Like now.	1
779	Like some part of him gets what he's putting his wife through, so he tried to-- kill himself?	1
780	Just like sane people can be illogical.	1
781	Just like you.	1
782	Just look at the light.	1
783	Just making an observation.	1
784	Just not a great influence.	1
785	Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.	1
786	Just one thing.	1
787	Just really love being a doctor so much.	1
788	Just relax.	1
789	Just sitting and praying.	1
790	Just so much and no more.	1
791	Just some irritation from lying in bed all day.	1
792	Just take it.	1
793	Just tell him about your parents or make up a lie.	1
794	Just tell me what's safe to inject in his thigh.	1
795	Just tell me your initial theory.	1
796	Just thought you might need someone to talk to about it.	1
797	Just to get his money.	1
798	Just trying to help you out here.	1
799	Just trying to understand you.	1
800	Just two more questions.	1
801	Just wanted to make sure all three were inside.	1
802	Just when they're beginning to, uh.	1
803	Just wrong about what?	1
804	It's our only choice.	1
805	It's part of the job.	1
806	It's plugged.	1
807	It's possible.	1
808	It's pretty genius.	1
809	It's probably aseptic meningitis.	1
810	It's probably from my seat belt.	1
811	It's probably nothing.	1
812	It's really screwed up to romanticize it.	1
813	It's Reye's syndrome.	1
814	It's silver.	1
815	It's Sophie.	1
816	It's stuck.	1
817	It's temperature that sets it off, not force.	1
818	It's the autumn.	1
819	It's the best thing for him.	1
820	It's the fundamental drive of our species.	1
821	It's the greatest mystery there is-- the theory of everything.	1
822	It's the mind's response to a severe trauma.	1
823	It's the most famous conjoined twins in history.	1
824	It's the neurochemical basis for bonding.	1
825	It's the same principle.	1
826	It's the silence, the contemplation, the order.	1
827	It's the stench of moralizing.	1
828	It's the swab for wheat-based allergies.	1
829	It's this new curve control thing.	1
830	It's tissue inflammation.	1
831	It's too late.	1
832	It's uncomfortable, isn't it?	1
833	It's under control.	1
834	It's up and running again.	1
835	It's usually a sign of a skull fracture.	1
836	It's what I'd do if I were him.	1
837	It's what my dad wants.	1
838	It's where we had our first date.	1
839	It's why I wanted to work with you.	1
840	It's your choice to make House a useful tool or a monkey wrench.	1
841	It's your first day back-- See?	1
842	It's your own fault.	1
843	It's your perfect patient.	1
844	It's, um.	1
845	It's.	1
846	It's--it's.	1
847	IV immunosuppressant to treat.	1
848	IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies, he'll be fine.	1
849	I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.	1
850	I've already got a religion.	1
851	I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned house with mold.	1
852	I've been considering applying to Doctors Without Borders.	1
853	I've been eating wheat my entire life.	1
854	I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.	1
855	I've been gaining more weight.	1
856	I've been ripping you all off for years.	1
857	I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's.	1
858	I've been second-guessing myself all day.	1
859	I've been trying to persuade the mother, but it's her son, so it's her call.	1
860	I've been waiting my entire life for that.	1
861	I've been waiting to do this for months.	1
862	I've decided that I would be doing this hospital a disservice if I did anything to change that process.	1
863	I've got an internship that starts in three weeks.	1
864	I've got it.	1
865	I've got only two years left in my stretch.	1
866	I've had dreams about this.	1
867	I've heard he's a wiggler.	1
868	I've informed Social Services of the mistake and given Jane Doe's description to the cops.	1
869	I've known my husband longer with his Alzheimer's than without.	1
870	I've never been hit in the eye before.	1
871	I've only been in here one week.	1
872	I've paged a team of our best doctors.	1
873	I've ruled out Wegener's, Berger's, heavy metal poison-- two trains are about to collide, and I'm trying to talk them out of it.	1
874	I've seen how you disrespect those patients.	1
875	I've spoken with Dr.	1
876	I've surfed all over the gold coast.	1
877	I've tapped over 30 guys and never wanted to see most of them again.	1
878	I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting someone in my own family, like when my brother tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.	1
879	I've watched more of him disappear than I ever got to know.	1
880	I--yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment, but, uh, I got a flat.	1
881	James Wilson, county coroner.	1
882	Jane Doe is flourishing without them.	1
883	Jiminy didn't chirp much last night.	1
884	Jobs are not being destroyed.	1
885	Joe, same thing with the engine rebuild.	1
886	John Woo movies, romance novels, kale.	1
887	Joint pain is common, but not definitive.	1
888	Joint pain, osteopenia, and anaphylaxis, eyebrow loss.	1
889	Joked about what a crappy deal you got for Manhattan?	1
890	Joseph helps me with my husband sometimes.	1
891	Jude's cemetery.	1
892	Judge's order for your immediate release.	1
893	Just a boy.	1
894	Just a sore throat a few weeks ago.	1
895	Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.	1
896	Just because that's what you'd miss the most.	1
897	Just because you hung up your lab coat for more money and a bigger office?	1
898	Just before you were.	1
899	Just betting on myself to solve the case.	1
900	Just bought yourself months in solitary.	1
901	Just came here to say thank you.	1
902	Just can't stand to think of all those patients going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work.	1
903	Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.	1
904	Just don't interrupt me.	1
905	Just drive me to the hospital.	1
906	Just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating.	1
907	Just enough to spoil your kids?	1
908	Just feels heavy when I do.	1
909	Just get a pulse OX.	1
910	Just give him five aspirin.	1
911	Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.	1
912	Just gonna put this right here.	1
913	Just got this.	1
914	Just hiding out till House leaves the cafeteria.	1
915	Just hurry up.	1
916	Just in case.	1
917	It got, like, over 75,000 hits already.	1
918	It happened so fast, I did--I-- I.	1
919	It hurts.	1
920	It is a thing.	1
921	It is crazy, but House doesn't do crazy just for crazy's sake.	1
922	It is gonna be hard.	1
923	It is in the water.	1
924	It is possible, but.	1
925	It just appeared in the last few weeks.	1
926	It just isn't worth it, House.	1
927	It just wouldn't be good for my health.	1
928	It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.	1
929	It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.	1
930	It looks very complicated.	1
931	It lowers libido and causes erectile dysfunction.	1
932	It makes a difference.	1
933	It makes me feel.	1
934	It makes me work harder.	1
935	It makes sense.	1
936	It makes you a healthy person.	1
937	It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.	1
938	It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.	1
939	It means he's got a tumor.	1
940	It means he's not paranoid, is an idiot, and was poisoned.	1
941	It means I've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.	1
942	It means we were wrong about lead.	1
943	It means you don't have to make that drive.	1
944	It might help if we knew the question.	1
945	It must be the descending branch.	1
946	It never took.	1
947	it overwhelmed him.	1
948	It probably doesn't mean anything, but we want to make sure.	1
949	It produces excess hormone.	1
950	It proved the patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.	1
951	It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to China.	1
952	It seems like Graves disease or some other thyroid issue.	1
953	It should have been me.	1
954	It should open up the airways and buy you some time until the lungs are ready.	1
955	It should.	1
956	It sort of does for me.	1
957	It sounds like there could be spinal cord involvement.	1
958	It sounds silly, but.	1
959	It stands to reason that your emotions factored in.	1
960	It started with card games.	1
961	It stumped two E.R. Docs and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.	1
962	It sucks that there was a stabbing.	1
963	It sucks, but the Filipino factories suck worse, and the schools would suck if they existed.	1
964	It took my parents years to get over it.	1
965	It was a 50/50 choice.	1
966	It was a con.	1
967	It was a controlled reaction that went a little haywire.	1
968	It was a gift.	1
969	It was a harmless prank.	1
970	It was a little harsh.	1
971	It was a long time ago, but still you're curious.	1
972	It was a moment of weakness.	1
973	It was a perfect diagnostic moment.	1
974	It was a prank.	1
975	It was a pretty tough conversation.	1
976	It was a rainy night.	1
977	It was a tactic.	1
978	It was a team-building exercise.	1
979	It was a three-plus 20 minutes ago.	1
980	It was a two-for-one sale.	1
981	It was aerosolized Heparin.	1
982	It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it.	1
983	It was close to here.	1
984	It was coagulated plasma.	1
985	It was elevated.	1
986	It was fine.	1
987	It was for our own good, but I don't care.	1
988	It was good advice.	1
989	It was good enough for my dad.	1
990	It was great knowing you.	1
991	It was her.	1
992	It was just paranoid rage, typical of Alzheimer's.	1
993	It was just your misinterpretation of them.	1
994	It was like he forgave me.	1
995	It was manipulation.	1
996	It was my fault daddy died.	1
997	It was my fault daddy's-- Oh, no.	1
998	It was my fault.	1
999	It was my husband.	1
1000	It was my theory.	1
1001	It was nice to meet you, Benjamin.	1
1002	It was nobody's fault.	1
1003	It was perfect.	1
1004	It was pure luck.	1
1005	It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.	1
1006	It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.	1
1007	It was stupid.	1
1008	It was the clot.	1
1009	It was the heat.	1
1010	It was too an explosion.	1
1011	It was ugly and painful, and she went with me hating her.	1
1012	It was wrong of me to confront you about taking Rachel to Portland.	1
1013	It wasn't a miscarriage.	1
1014	It wasn't caused by a v-fib.	1
1015	It wasn't enough.	1
1016	It wasn't exactly an explosion.	1
1017	It wasn't her mom.	1
1018	It wasn't my boyfriend.	1
1019	It wasn't the food.	1
1020	It wasn't uncommon.	1
1021	It wasn't your fault.	1
1022	It went to interior designers, I understand.	1
1023	It went well.	1
1024	It will.	1
1025	It worked.	1
1026	It works out well for everyone.	1
1027	It would have to be pretty far along because the first symptom was just a few days ago.	1
1028	It wouldn't be a gift.	1
1029	It wouldn't cross them.	1
1030	Itching.	1
1031	It'd take a half hour to set up.	1
1032	I--the bet is-- - But I thought-- - After-- - then-- - I--oh-- if only.	1
1033	It--it doesn't even make sense.	1
1034	It'll be terrible.	1
1035	It'll just take a minute.	1
1036	It'll raise his temperature enough that his heart should naturally start.	1
1037	It's 10:15 on Friday.	1
1038	It's 3:30 in the morning.	1
1039	It's a bathroom.	1
1040	It's a brain problem.	1
1041	It's a clot in the radicular artery.	1
1042	It's a conclusive test.	1
1043	It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm found in feces.	1
1044	It's a family heirloom, which means old money.	1
1045	It's a genetic condition characterized by kidney failure, bronchial myomas, Mees' lines, and deafness.	1
1046	It's a German name.	1
1047	It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.	1
1048	It's a good thing that worked.	1
1049	It's a hospital.	1
1050	It's a little late for that.	1
1051	It's a little more than like.	1
1052	It's a little weird without the rash, but it fits all of his other symptoms.	1
1053	It's a major surgery.	1
1054	It's a medical diagnosis.	1
1055	It's a medical procedure.	1
1056	It's a one-off.	1
1057	It's a pleural effusion.	1
1058	I was at my lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.	1
1059	I was being authentic.	1
1060	I was crying, and he couldn't drive.	1
1061	I was eating a baby for lunch, and.	1
1062	I was expecting a battery of lawyers.	1
1063	I was giving you the gift of deniability.	1
1064	I was gonna leave that implied, but, yes, colossal drunk.	1
1065	I was gonna make you bring me a bottle.	1
1066	I was happy watching the fight on pay-per-view.	1
1067	I was having sex at a motel when I started to feel light-headed.	1
1068	I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.	1
1069	I was in prison, you see.	1
1070	I was in the room.	1
1071	I was just a teenager.	1
1072	I was just getting to that part.	1
1073	I was just trying to protect him, like I should have done from the start.	1
1074	I was married once.	1
1075	I was right about the antiemetics.	1
1076	I was right.	1
1077	I was running away.	1
1078	I was sick of living a lie.	1
1079	I was stabbed by a patient.	1
1080	I was thinking just the two of us.	1
1081	I was thinking of something more.	1
1082	I was thinking.	1
1083	I was told that this might be my last chance to see my son.	1
1084	I was trying to use the phone.	1
1085	I was trying to.	1
1086	I was two.	1
1087	I'll do the flushing.	1
1088	I'll double them.	1
1089	I'll dress 'em the same, like in Vertigo.	1
1090	I'll drive over there.	1
1091	I'll explain later.	1
1092	I'll fix it.	1
1093	I'll get it at a clinic.	1
1094	I'll get the car and meet you out front.	1
1095	I'll get the food.	1
1096	I'll give $1 million as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.	1
1097	I'll give it to you.	1
1098	I'll give you your money.	1
1099	I'll go check on the patient.	1
1100	I'll just tell you what I was-- Ah, ah, ah, ah! No spoilers.	1
1101	I'll keep looking here.	1
1102	I'll leave you and Dr.	1
1103	I'll let you know when we have the results.	1
1104	I'll look for toxins myself.	1
1105	I'll make you a counter.	1
1106	I'll never be able to explain, never tell her how sorry I am.	1
1107	I'll pick something up.	1
1108	I'll run some blood tests.	1
1109	I'll send him up.	1
1110	I'll shoot you.	1
1111	I'll start him on hematin.	1
1112	I'll stay.	1
1113	I'm betting on them both being yours.	1
1114	I'm buying.	1
1115	I'm comin'.	1
1116	I'm consulting on this case.	1
1117	I'm defending the dad because he got screwed.	1
1118	I'm doing it to help my patient.	1
1119	I'm doing my job, part of which is to make sure House does his.	1
1120	I'm done.	1
1121	I'm enjoying our conversation.	1
1122	I'm faint.	1
1123	I'm feeling much better now.	1
1124	I'll be deciding your fate today.	1
1125	I'll be doing what you would have done a year ago.	1
1126	I'll be here as much as you need.	1
1127	I'll be in surgery.	1
1128	I'll be right back.	1
1129	I'll bet House re.	1
1130	I'll buy options instead of shares.	1
1131	I'll call you back.	1
1132	I'll clear it with your parole officer.	1
1133	I'll deny it, and he'll believe you.	1
1134	I'll do it myself.	1
1135	I'll take the fallout from Social Services.	1
1136	I'll take this outside.	1
1137	I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs.	1
1138	I'll try the marrow registry.	1
1139	I'll wait.	1
1140	I'll watch the baby again, and you can get a real night's sleep.	1
1141	I'll X-ray him on Friday.	1
1142	I'll--I'll bet some of them bore you.	1
1143	I'm a drug addict.	1
1144	I'm a good doctor.	1
1145	I'm a little confused.	1
1146	I'm a murderer.	1
1147	I'm a neurologist over at-- I know who you are.	1
1148	I'm a talented physician, top 2% of my class.	1
1149	I'm actually concerned it might be because of the change in management.	1
1150	I'm actually thinking of just getting my ged.	1
1151	I'm Adele Brown from Social Services, and this is-- I'm Ellen Rogers.	1
1152	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you.	1
1153	I'm all right.	1
1154	I'm also sorry.	1
1155	I'm an ass.	1
1156	I'm an asset to this hospital, an asset you're about to lose to Chicago.	1
1157	I'm an ex-con trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by.	1
1158	I'm Anita.	1
1159	I'm assuming you're thinking something genetic, because-- I'm thinking addiction.	1
1160	I'm beginning to think we should just go with House's idea.	1
1161	I'm being professional.	1
1162	I'm getting by by the way it's you on my mind Would you like to get a drink sometime after work?	1
1163	I'm glad you feel that way, because I do have a favor to ask.	1
1164	I'm glad you're back.	1
1165	I'm going back to work.	1
1166	I'm going to admit you.	1
1167	I'm going to assume this is another one.	1
1168	I'm going to that fight.	1
1169	I'm going with my girlfriend.	1
1170	I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning.	1
1171	I'm gonna call the ambulance! No.	1
1172	I'm gonna call your P.	1
1173	I'm gonna do a quick breast exam.	1
1174	I'm gonna do the surgery.	1
1175	I'm gonna drop our kids off at my mother's.	1
1176	I'm gonna fix this.	1
1177	I'm gonna get better at it, and it's not a hobby.	1
1178	I'm gonna get through eventually.	1
1179	I'm gonna go give him P.	1
1180	I'm gonna have to dial back the nitro.	1
1181	I'm gonna let him be a donor.	1
1182	I'm gonna need a continuance.	1
1183	I'm gonna need number three Vicryls.	1
1184	I'm gonna need that too.	1
1185	I'm gonna need to see some stamps, uh, stereo-- just get 'em to me as soon as you can.	1
1186	I'm gonna need to see some tuna.	1
1187	I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your house.	1
1188	I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with.	1
1189	I'm gonna start him on ceftriaxone.	1
1190	I'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling and try to make a go of this.	1
1191	I'm gonna try again.	1
1192	I'm good.	1
1193	I'm growing more and more curious by the moment.	1
1194	I'm guessing ankle monitor.	1
1195	I'm guessing he does things like that a lot.	1
1196	I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.	1
1197	I'm guessing it's a little of both.	1
1198	I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.	1
1199	I'm happy I knew you.	1
1200	I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.	1
1201	I'm her daughter.	1
1202	I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I-- we're too busy for rationalizations.	1
1203	I'm here for the free flu shot.	1
1204	I'm here for Vanessa.	1
1205	I'm his wife.	1
1206	I'm in a dump with a guy almost twice my age.	1
1207	I'm in a meeting.	1
1208	I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.	1
1209	I'm Jewish.	1
1210	I'm ju reading the notes on your desk.	1
1211	I'm just disagreeing, not overruling.	1
1212	I'm just done.	1
1213	I'm just glad it's over.	1
1214	I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for China.	1
1215	I'm just looking for something more.	1
1216	I'm just playing solitaire.	1
1217	I'm kind of a wreck.	1
1218	I'm kind of busy.	1
1219	I'm late for work in the clinic.	1
1220	I'm Miss Cedarville.	1
1221	I'm more clever and more devious.	1
1222	I'm multitasking.	1
1223	I'm never quite sure.	1
1224	I'm not a doctor anymore, House.	1
1225	I'm not a nutcase.	1
1226	I'm not allergic to wheat.	1
1227	I'm not an addict.	1
1228	I'm not an idiot.	1
1229	I'm not angry.	1
1230	I'm not being a dick.	1
1231	I'm not coming back, House.	1
1232	I'm not doing this for you.	1
1233	I'm not done testifying.	1
1234	I'm not emotionally involved with her.	1
1235	I'm not giving up.	1
1236	I'm not going to lose.	1
1237	I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.	1
1238	I'm not gonna interfere.	1
1239	I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.	1
1240	I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.	1
1241	I'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.	1
1242	I'm not joking.	1
1243	I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.	1
1244	I'm not like you, House.	1
1245	I'm not loaning my boss money.	1
1246	I'm not looking for excitement.	1
1247	I'm not lost I'm just looking for the prince and I'm taking it one step at a time and I'm getting by  	1
1248	I'm not mad.	1
1249	I'm not not the relationship type.	1
1250	I'm not paranoid.	1
1251	I'm not really an affair guy after all.	1
1252	I'm not saying I don't have faith.	1
1253	I'm not seeing an embryo anywhere.	1
1254	I'm not seeing any calcifications.	1
1255	I'm not shooting you.	1
1256	I'm not sloppy seconds.	1
1257	I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was.	1
1258	I'm not taking the risk.	1
1259	I'm not the bad guy here.	1
1260	I'm not the man you thought I was.	1
1261	I'm not working, House.	1
1262	I'm not worried.	1
1263	I'm not.	1
1264	I'm okay.	1
1265	I'm only here to help.	1
1266	I'm only moving it to China because I'm craving egg foo yung.	1
1267	I'm out of here on Friday.	1
1268	I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.	1
1269	I'm protecting my diagnosis.	1
1270	I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.	1
1271	I'm proud to have been a part of it, but.	1
1272	I'm really just keeping the seat warm.	1
1273	I'm really sorry.	1
1274	I'm running a special on grilled cheese this week.	1
1275	I'm running PCR test now.	1
1276	I'm running to God.	1
1277	I'm scared of everything.	1
1278	I'm seeing a trauma counselor.	1
1279	I'm short on cash this month.	1
1280	I'm sick.	1
1281	I'm smiling because, for the last 12 hours, I've been picturing you with orange hair.	1
1282	I'm so dead.	1
1283	If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero.	1
1284	If the kid had a rash or some circulation issue.	1
1285	If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom never took him to a dermatologist?	1
1286	If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.	1
1287	If the patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.	1
1288	If the plumbing's fine, check the electrical.	1
1289	If there's a little blood bubbling up, that's normal.	1
1290	If there's even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.	1
1291	If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove?	1
1292	If they found out what I've done, they'd be mortified.	1
1293	If they're hiding inside the lung cells.	1
1294	If this is really about family, you will not do this.	1
1295	If we add clotting disorder to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.	1
1296	If we both do our jobs, we might actually get him through his parole.	1
1297	If we had more data on the exact type of melanoma his father had.	1
1298	If we had, the patient would have been anesthetized hours ago, thus unable to go all Chris Brown on her ass.	1
1299	If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here.	1
1300	If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection.	1
1301	If we keep her off, she'll be moody, but healthy.	1
1302	If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.	1
1303	If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?	1
1304	If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.	1
1305	If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff.	1
1306	If you don't mind me asking, why are you becoming a nun?	1
1307	If you don't mind paying a fortune in child support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.	1
1308	If you double his placebo, he might drown.	1
1309	If you ever hear me mention anything about wanting kids, please feel free to punch me in the liver.	1
1310	If you get him, what's that gonna prove?	1
1311	If you had actually been in the room, questioning the patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.	1
1312	If you had been in that room, maybe that could have been you.	1
1313	If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist.	1
1314	If you hadn't been screwing with me and put the idea in my head.	1
1315	If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call.	1
1316	If you keep being stubborn, he will keep being stubborn.	1
1317	If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.	1
1318	If you kill him, we're looking at.	1
1319	If you like tuna, you're a little late.	1
1320	If you move it, it'll be without me.	1
1321	If you need help, you can take whoever you want.	1
1322	If you need to talk to someone, a professional.	1
1323	If you only heard claudication and carotid dissection.	1
1324	If you really love them back, then.	1
1325	If you stay, we have to have a hearing.	1
1326	If you think you're up to this job, it's time to lose them.	1
1327	If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciprocate.	1
1328	If you want an accurate patient history, don't ever talk to the patient.	1
1329	If you want my money, I'll need to see a five-year plan.	1
1330	If you want silence, you can get ear plugs.	1
1331	If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time.	1
1332	If you want.	1
1333	If you were me, what would you do?	1
1334	If you weren't wrestling with this, I'd say there's something really wrong with you.	1
1335	If you'd have seen some of the kitchens or the processing plants I have, you'd cook all your own food too.	1
1336	If you'd like to talk to someone, we do have grief counselors at the hospital.	1
1337	If your mom abused you, Social Services won't let you go home with her.	1
1338	If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick.	1
1339	If your own kids are a scheduling item, maybe you should let one of them move.	1
1340	If you're a match, but to increase our odds, we'd like to get your friends and faly tested as well.	1
1341	If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.	1
1342	If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.	1
1343	If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.	1
1344	If you're looking for someone to blame.	1
1345	If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.	1
1346	If you're right, calcium channel blocker the lungs have no nervous system.	1
1347	If you're speaking as a team member, then I'd say you're a moron.	1
1348	If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine, then I'd say you're a moron.	1
1349	If.	1
1350	IgA nephropathy.	1
1351	I--I can't get all 20, but once I get out-- Give us a minute.	1
1352	I-I checked online, and it's.	1
1353	I-I did something stupid last night, but it was a one-time thing.	1
1354	I--I didn't know.	1
1355	I-I think House set me up.	1
1356	I-I think I want to get a job working as a circus clown, making people laugh.	1
1357	I-I thought it made them deeper somehow.	1
1358	I--I was scared.	1
1359	I'll admit I was weak for a moment, but I'm not doing this.	1
1360	I'll be around.	1
1361	Ibuprofen?	1
1362	Ickiness?	1
1363	Icky.	1
1364	ICU isolation room.	1
1365	ICU stands for take your time in Latin.	1
1366	I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.	1
1367	I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word.	1
1368	I'd like to ask you about your grandson, Drew Lemaine.	1
1369	I'd like to do that.	1
1370	I'd like to sit in.	1
1371	I'd like to try forcing an oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.	1
1372	I'd like you to do it.	1
1373	I'd love to go myself, which is kind of why I have to stop him.	1
1374	I'd prefer to be paid in a single $100 bill.	1
1375	I'd say giant cell arteritis.	1
1376	I'd say I'm in the book, but not the one you'll be reading from now on.	1
1377	I'd take you if I could.	1
1378	I'd want my husband to tell me the truth.	1
1379	Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option.	1
1380	Idiot.	1
1381	Idiots.	1
1382	If Adams is right, he'll spike a fever, get hypotensive, we can treat it.	1
1383	If all you do is physical therapy and your nighttime version of it, you'll lose your mind faster than you regain those fine motor skills.	1
1384	If anarchy breaks out, I plan to do what my ancestors have done throughout the ages--run.	1
1385	If everyone did that, we'd never find a donor for anyone again.	1
1386	If Foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes, coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.	1
1387	If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?	1
1388	If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.	1
1389	If he has myelodysplastic syndrome, he'll bleed out.	1
1390	If he thinks this is the only way to help your patient.	1
1391	If he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the X-ray to do the autopsy.	1
1392	If he's paranoid.	1
1393	If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.	1
1394	If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.	1
1395	If I ever see you in here again, I will write you up, and they will revoke your parole.	1
1396	If I get this done in five minutes, she won't stroke out.	1
1397	If I had the power to veto him, given all the crap I've put up with over the years, don't know if I could use it objectively.	1
1398	If I have to plough that furrow myself, so be it.	1
1399	If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor.	1
1400	If I wanted you to be like me.	1
1401	If I were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, I would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way and-- Sorry.	1
1402	If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.	1
1403	If it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have to repair it.	1
1404	If it fails, then you will actually have proven that you can control me.	1
1405	If it makes Andrews look sympathetic.	1
1406	If it makes you feel better to think that.	1
1407	If it saves a life, who cares?	1
1408	If it was an allergic reaction, the Corticosteroids and Epinephrine would have made him better, not worse.	1
1409	If it was GAD, he'd be having seizures.	1
1410	If it was infection, there would be some sign of it in his blood or CNS.	1
1411	If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.	1
1412	If it's a disease, then he's six inches under.	1
1413	If it's a synthetic problem, more fluid will leak into h chest and his heart will fail.	1
1414	If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.	1
1415	If it's hyperammonemic, toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma.	1
1416	If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant.	1
1417	If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.	1
1418	If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care.	1
1419	If it's only in his epithelium, it wouldn't show up in his chest X-ray.	1
1420	If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here, you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.	1
1421	If marriage is feeding and cleaning someone, limiting conversations, to repeating a few simple commands, then I was married to my pet rat.	1
1422	If my father had lived, everything would have been different.	1
1423	If not for cheating, I might still have a wife, but I wouldn't have Sophie and Sophia.	1
1424	If one of them's a match, that'd speed things up a lot.	1
1425	If only burnt lungs explained the passing out and paralysis.	1
1426	If only it would explain why we've never seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.	1
1427	If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden.	1
1428	If our donor had an allergy, it could explain the lungs.	1
1429	If Park is right, he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us, we can cross brain off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.	1
1430	If she defies me.	1
1431	If she dies, we'll be in the middle of a brand-new investigation.	1
1432	If she had any sense, she'd have stuck him in a facility and jumped on that strange-- Dr.	1
1433	If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.	1
1434	If signing off on everything House does is a pattern, it affects the way House behaves, it affects the way House's team reacts to the way House behaves.	1
1435	If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured.	1
1436	I think it should give you solace, help you to move on.	1
1437	I think it was eerily.	1
1438	I think it's his liver.	1
1439	I think it's just dehydration.	1
1440	I think it's Whipple's disease.	1
1441	I think maybe you should go.	1
1442	I think she might make it this time.	1
1443	I think so.	1
1444	I think that little of you and that much of me.	1
1445	I think the ledger's clear.	1
1446	I think they got the cause of death wrong.	1
1447	I think they were happy.	1
1448	I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.	1
1449	I think we should run a pregnancy test.	1
1450	I think we should talk about Lena's grandchildren.	1
1451	I think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum-- which will kill him if it's a GAD autoimmunity.	1
1452	I think you refer to it as petty cash.	1
1453	I think you should cancel my hearing.	1
1454	I think you should get a biopsy.	1
1455	I think you should give House permission to go to Atlantic City.	1
1456	I think you should too.	1
1457	I think your symptoms are the result of alcohol abuse.	1
1458	I think you're a good person and a fine doctor, but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons.	1
1459	I think you're having a heart attack.	1
1460	I think you're right about the strep.	1
1461	I thought for sure there'd be some yelling or profanity, possible bloodletting.	1
1462	I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.	1
1463	I thought I was here to treat the patients, not entertain you.	1
1464	I thought I was right about the rash.	1
1465	I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.	1
1466	I thought it was interesting she couldn't accept that coffee.	1
1467	I thought it was lead.	1
1468	I thought it was relevant.	1
1469	I thought it'd be different.	1
1470	I thought of you on mom's birthday.	1
1471	I thought Park and Adams were both right but that their conclusions were both wrong.	1
1472	I thought so ?	1
1473	I should have told you.	1
1474	I should just drive my car didn't it turn out that he'd stolen the hot dog cart?	1
1475	I shouldn't be here.	1
1476	I shouldn't have lied about it.	1
1477	I shudder to think what that world would be like.	1
1478	I smell empathy.	1
1479	I sometimes joke.	1
1480	I specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.	1
1481	I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the patient.	1
1482	I spent a month in solitary.	1
1483	I spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision.	1
1484	I spent half my time changing diapers and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.	1
1485	I spent the night with her.	1
1486	I spoke to the head of neurology in Chicago.	1
1487	I spoke to the prioress.	1
1488	I stand corrected.	1
1489	I started the last round of pleconaril.	1
1490	I started with 10 million, and I couldn't think of a reason not to give 20.	1
1491	I still don't think it's neurological.	1
1492	I still have my software company.	1
1493	I suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by childhood abuse.	1
1494	I suppose so.	1
1495	I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and manpower just to let this guy watch his mind shrivel and keep his wife miserable.	1
1496	I take it felonies aren't a violation of your parole?	1
1497	I take it it's not at a place with a big top.	1
1498	I take it you're in the latter category.	1
1499	I talk to prisoners.	1
1500	I talked to Chase and Taub.	1
1501	I tell her it's vitamin C.	1
1502	I th--I think I'm gonna go.	1
1503	I think he actually has a good point.	1
1504	I think he said exoplanets.	1
1505	I think he's about to throw us out.	1
1506	I think his gist was.	1
1507	I think House is right.	1
1508	I think I love you.	1
1509	I think I may throw up.	1
1510	I think I might have said insane.	1
1511	I think I need a bigger dose.	1
1512	I think I really dodged a bullet there.	1
1513	I think I'm gonna-- all right, I admit it.	1
1514	I thought that was Nadine.	1
1515	I thought the bracelet was decorative.	1
1516	I thought the patient had a liver problem.	1
1517	I thought the patient had normal pressure hydrocephalus.	1
1518	I thought threatening him with jail would be different.	1
1519	I thought we'd gotten past that.	1
1520	I thought you don't like favors.	1
1521	I thought you had a team for that.	1
1522	I thought you said that guy was one of your best doctors.	1
1523	I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.	1
1524	I thought you were gonna go to bed early last night.	1
1525	I thought you were referring to talking.	1
1526	I thought you'd rather see the company go under in New Jersey than thrive in China.	1
1527	I told him because it was the right thing to do.	1
1528	I told him to tell his wife he cheated, not confess every sin he's ever committed.	1
1529	I told House I couldn't come back until next week.	1
1530	I told House I thought it was a mistake.	1
1531	I told my husband about you.	1
1532	I told the drunk, racist frat guy the proper term is conjoined twin, not Siamese.	1
1533	I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.	1
1534	I told you my son didn't do cocaine.	1
1535	I told you, I was sitting at my desk when the attack happened.	1
1536	I took a vacation.	1
1537	I took that scalpel for you.	1
1538	I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor.	1
1539	I trained to be a Doctor.	1
1540	I treated an inmate once with similar symptoms after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.	1
1541	I tried the outside world.	1
1542	I tried to learn when we got married, but I just-- it's okay.	1
1543	I tried.	1
1544	I understand that we're in a hurry but maybe he should.	1
1545	I used to wait until you went to bed.	1
1546	I usually have a student aide help me set it up, and apparently this year he added extra hydrofluoric acid, which is why it exploded.	1
1547	I visit her grave once a week.	1
1548	I vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour celebrating your freedom, justified, of course, by some absurd theory connecting it to donor.	1
1549	I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.	1
1550	I walk in in a suit, and they're gonna put their best foot forward.	1
1551	I want a steak.	1
1552	I want and need parents.	1
1553	I want the surgery.	1
1554	I want to be with them.	1
1555	I want to build a connection with him, pass on some of the.	1
1556	I want to make sure I can position her wrist properly.	1
1557	I want to pay attention to them, but they're just so.	1
1558	I want your stereo and your headphones.	1
1559	I wanted to reassure you.	1
1560	I wanted to see how deep it went.	1
1561	I wanted to spend my life with him, but.	1
1562	I wanted to spend my life with you.	1
1563	I wanted you to do a tilt table test.	1
1564	I wanted you to feel better.	1
1565	I wanted you to move on with your life.	1
1566	I was a mess, and she just sat there like.	1
1567	I was a seminarian.	1
1568	I was an ass last week.	1
1569	I was angry, but I wasn't distracted.	1
1570	I wasn't at a funeral.	1
1571	I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.	1
1572	I wasn't exactly wrestling with great theological questions.	1
1573	I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.	1
1574	I wasn't thinking.	1
1575	I wasn't.	1
1576	I went by neurology.	1
1577	I went through a rebellious phase.	1
1578	I went to prison.	1
1579	I will be once you just.	1
1580	I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it.	1
1581	I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words.	1
1582	I will see you this weekend when you pick up Sophie.	1
1583	I will shred this.	1
1584	I won this off her prop master in a poker game.	1
1585	I won't go near her.	1
1586	I won't tell them anything.	1
1587	I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.	1
1588	I would do it again.	1
1589	I would have donated the money to charity.	1
1590	I would have gone with colossal drunk.	1
1591	I would just be you telling the truth.	1
1592	I would love for him to get out of here before the market opens.	1
1593	I would love to be able to do it.	1
1594	I would never do something like that.	1
1595	I would strongly advise.	1
1596	I wouldn't be doing this if I thought there was another way.	1
1597	I wouldn't believe it.	1
1598	I wouldn't blame anyone if you decide.	1
1599	I wouldn't have been in the room.	1
1600	I wouldn't mind a couple more details.	1
1601	I wouldn't worry about it.	1
1602	I, uh, have this terrible pain in my left shoulder.	1
1603	I, uh.	1
1604	Oh, that's fine.	1
1605	Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring.	1
1606	Oh, um.	1
1607	Oh, we kiss and cuddle, but neither one of us is interested in sex.	1
1608	Oh, whatever it takes.	1
1609	Oh, yeah, your-- grabbed your tushy.	1
1610	Oh, yeah.	1
1611	Oh, yeah?	1
1612	Oh, yes, they do! They're gonna find out eventually.	1
1613	Oh, you could P.C. up.	1
1614	Oh, you don't wanna bet me.	1
1615	Oh, you mean the.	1
1616	Oh, you think they're.	1
1617	Oh, you will.	1
1618	Oh, you.	1
1619	Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone.	1
1620	Oh, you're right.	1
1621	O que e isso?	1
1622	No, you're not.	1
1623	No, you're right-- I really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff! The stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.	1
1624	Now?	1
1625	Nowhere .	1
1626	Nowhere near enough vitamin A.	1
1627	Now's your chance.	1
1628	Nuh-uh.	1
1629	Number three went to a baseball game the day before he donated.	1
1630	Oh, now I just want to win.	1
1631	Oh, now you wanna help me.	1
1632	Oh, now you're shy.	1

2026	My mom will be happy to hear that.	1
2027	My mom, she died four months ago.	1
2028	My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean, and my boss grabbed my behind.	1

2058	Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it.	1
2059	Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.	1

2061	Multiple birds, single stone.	1
2062	Multiple warm lavage is safer.	1

2284	So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?	1
2285	So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years.	1
2286	So you do realize that it is unacceptable to hit someone in the workplace?	1
2287	So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head.	1
2288	So you guys are trying to manipulate me by playing good cop/good cop?	1
2289	So you just ran away, lived with friends, and partied with guys that you knew your parents would hate.	1
2290	So you just wanted to look pretty on TV.	1
2291	So you made daddy go away and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.	1
2292	So you need to prove your superiority.	1
2293	So you treated with steroids.	1
2294	So you wanna research it?	1
2295	So you want twice as many of them disrespected?	1
2296	So you'll let him go?	1
2297	So your daughter was wrong.	1
2298	So your testimony is that Dr.	1
2299	So you're just gonna let me walk out of here.	1
2300	So you're saying I got the clap?	1
2301	So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect.	1
2302	So you're zen about it but won't let go of your anger toward House?	1
2303	So, at 6:00 a.m. , the patient wakes up, and the first thing he sees.	1
2304	So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.	1
2305	So are we gonna spend the rest of eternity in a lake of fire while pointy-tailed demons poke at us with sticks?	1
2306	So are you! She's found something she wants to build her life around.	1
2307	So as much as my better nature really wants to give you a pass.	1
2308	So best-case scenario, I've just had a glimpse into his future?	1
2309	So can I get back to work?	1
2310	So do I wish mom had used a gun instead of a bottle?	1
2311	So do you.	1
2312	So don't tell him.	1
2313	So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.	1
2314	So for the past few months I've been.	1
2315	So forget being sorry.	1
2316	So glad I was wrong.	1
2317	So glad you're on board.	1
2318	So go back to work at the hospital.	1
2319	So he could die before he gets one.	1
2320	So he has two types of people inside of him.	1
2321	So he was obviously afraid of something.	1
2322	So I can look at them.	1
2323	So I chose night.	1
2324	So I decided, if I was gonna be the grown-up, I'd rather do it on my own terms.	1
2325	So I for sure got lung cancer?	1
2326	So I found a way to let you know to not be late.	1

2333	So if I give you $200,000, I'll feel smart and pretty.	1
2334	So I'm gonna be completely cured.	1
2335	So I'm just lying about everything?	1
2336	So I'm right.	1
2337	So is House.	1
2338	So it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.	1
2339	So it's really over $100?	1
2340	So I've heard.	1
2341	So many children of your own.	1
2342	So maybe a solvent or detergent?	1
2343	So maybe she's lying.	1
2344	So much for genetics mattering.	1
2345	So much.	1
2346	So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights.	1
2347	So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.	1
2348	So that must have been nice, having Ruby and the baby under one roof.	1
2349	So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen.	1
2350	So that's really weird.	1
2351	So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat.	1
2352	So there's something wrong with her.	1
2353	So they thought the patient would be better by now.	1
2354	So they'll never testify against me.	1
2355	So this is the family's best hope.	1
2356	So this is you trying to help me?	1
2357	So this isn't diabetes?	1
2358	So this was a team-building exercise?	1
2359	So we agreed that he would come in, but wouldn't touch the patient.	1
2360	So we discussed it a little longer, and House decided to treat with Heparin.	1
2361	So we figured the patient inhaled the extra large dose of hydrofluoric acid and.	1
2362	So we're back to square none?	1
2363	So we're good?	1
2364	So we've got nothing.	1
2365	So what do you think-- is the patient paranoid or am I?	1
2366	So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?	1
2367	So what's next for you?	1
2368	So what's the answer?	1
2369	So when I see symptoms magically show up right when you need them-- And I was your boss for seven years.	1
2370	So who cheated on you?	1
2371	S.T.D. panel was negative.	1
2372	S08E05 The Confession By Mikhel for: Subtitulos.	1
2373	Said he'd have his decision tomorrow.	1
2374	Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her.	1
2375	Said the divorced woman to the divorced man.	1
2376	Said to tell you he's no longer your patient.	1
2377	Saline flow is down to 10 ccs.	1
2378	Saline's flushing it forward but getting no return.	1
2379	Same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you.	1
2380	Same thing happened to me.	1
2381	Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.	1
2382	Sarcoidosis.	1
2383	Save people's lives instead of just their noses?	1
2384	Save your asses.	1
2385	Saving one life is good.	1
2386	Saving two is better.	1
2387	Saving us both from contraband charges.	1
2388	Say what?	1
2389	Say you're right.	1
2390	Saying no will cause both of us pain.	1
2391	Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.	1
2392	Says so in the file.	1
2393	Says the doctors here can no longer be objective since the stabbing.	1
2394	Scalpel.	1
2395	Scam extra Vicodin, back to jail.	1
2396	Schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.	1

2400	Screw the parents.	1
2401	Screwed up is your best case.	1
2402	Search the home for toxic plants, methyl bromide, any medications.	1
2403	Second half of my plan might need work.	1
2404	Second-guessing my best doctors shouldn't be one of them.	1
2405	See if I can handle working with him.	1
2406	see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.	1
2407	See what a tough spot I'm in?	1
2408	See ya.	1
2409	See you tomorrow morning.	1
2410	Robbie?	1
2411	Robert.	1
2412	Robert?	1
2413	ROFL.	1
2414	Rollo followed me in and took it.	1
2415	Root canal and Berger's.	1
2416	Root canal, if done correctly, doesn't look like kidney disease.	1
2417	'Round-the-clock or not, parenting's an impossible job.	1
2418	Rubbing alcohol, vinegar.	1
2419	Ruby dropped her off.	1

2431	Sick.	1
2432	Sickness and health, right?	1
2433	Significant because Santos hasn't heard the final bell in more than six years.	1
2434	Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.	1
2435	Simon Harris filmed the whole thing on his camera phone and posted it on YouTube.	1
2436	Simpson.	1
2437	Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club.	1
2438	Since Claudine left, no one's been inputting the numbers.	1
2439	Since I have my kids for the next two days, I need a babysitter.	1
2440	Since I have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him.	1
2441	Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting.	1
2442	Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.	1
2443	Sir, are you questioning my resolve?	1
2444	Sis and I were talking, trying to figure out how many hospital sleepovers we've had.	1
2445	Six a week.	1
2446	Six years ago, I was a nanny in Honolulu for this beautiful two-year-old boy.	1
2447	Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis and cerebral arteritis.	1
2448	Sjogren's it is.	1
2449	Sleep study.	1
2450	Slope changer.	1
2451	Smart girl.	1
2452	Smells funny.	1
2453	Smile and say thank you.	1
2454	So a few people are nice to you, and your first thought is, Hmm, this seems strange ?	1
2455	So a guy gives everything Sane.	1
2456	So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was-- Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter.	1
2457	So all parents screw up all children, but it makes some huge difference if I keep my daughter here or let her move?	1
2458	Taking her off made it more apparent.	1
2459	Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.	1
2460	Taking my vic-amins.	1
2461	Talking about medicine.	1
2462	Taped under your chair is an index card.	1
2463	Taub did a third.	1
2464	Taub has decided.	1
2465	Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.	1
2466	Taub is interrogating the janitor.	1
2467	Taub, Chase, Thirteen all moved on.	1
2468	Taub, it's Foreman.	1
2469	Taub, you got a minute?	1
2470	Taub's got this.	1
2471	Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.	1
2472	Taxes.	1
2473	Technically, you're back right now.	1
2474	Telecast, we expect an electric atmosphere in the arena and a sellout crowd of about 10,000 for Rubio versus Santos, two great fighters with illustrious careers who might have been expected to meet a long time ago.	1
2475	Tell all the alters that they have cancer.	1
2476	Tell him to keep his hand off me.	1
2477	Tell him! Do the surgery.	1
2478	Tell me about it.	1
2479	Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride.	1
2480	Tell me.	1
2481	Tell my why.	1
2482	Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.	1
2483	Tell the Dean that I don't want to see her.	1
2484	Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.	1
2485	Telling the truth may have just killed this guy.	1
2486	Temporal lobes are clear.	1
2487	Temp's at 93.	1
2488	Ten clinic hours.	1
2489	Ten?	1
2490	Terrible.	1
2491	Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.	1
2492	Test came back positive.	1
2493	Test me again.	1
2494	Test me.	1
2495	Test my urine.	1
2496	Test shows she's still pregnant.	1
2497	Thad Barton?	1
2498	Thank God.	1
2499	Thank you so much for coming here.	1
2500	Thank you, Doctor.	1
2501	Thank you, Igor.	1
2502	Thank you, officer.	1
2503	Son of a bitch! Get away from them! House, House! It's a genetic condition! - Shut up! - Genetic! Your father has the gene.	1
2504	Soon is good.	1
2505	Sophia.	1
2506	Sorry about that.	1
2507	Sorry about yesterday.	1
2508	Sorry to mess with your world view, but I'm not messed up, so my parents couldn't have messed me up.	1
2509	Sorry to show up like this.	1
2510	Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, I assume that plagiarism is the new black.	1
2511	Sorry, Dr.	1
2512	Sorry, I.	1
2513	Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.	1
2514	Sort of.	1
2515	Sounds like a good plan.	1
2516	Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.	1
2517	Sounds like drowning.	1
2518	Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?	1
2519	Speaks to a certain callousness on Dr.	1
2520	Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.	1
2521	Specifically.	1
2522	Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more humanely.	1
2523	Spoiled grandchildren.	1
2524	Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.	1
2525	Surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance.	1
2526	Surgery's off.	1
2527	Surprised you didn't go into the diplomatic corps.	1
2528	Suture.	1
2529	Sweet kid.	1
2530	Swelling that fast and localized has to come from the lymph nodes.	1
2531	Swelling would have followed gravity.	1
2532	Swelling.	1
2533	Switching rooms can be very disorienting.	1
2534	Syph test was negative.	1
2535	Syphilis.	1
2536	Syphilitic vasculitis would explain the T.I.A.	1
2537	Syrinx formed in the subarachnoid space, blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.	1
2538	Systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.	1
2539	Squamous cell middle ear tumor could have caused the ear bleed.	1
2540	Sri Lankan Independence Day.	1
2541	Stand by for.	1

2548	Start him on plasmapheresis.	1
2549	Start him on radiation.	1
2550	Start him on.	1
2551	Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.	1
2552	Start the patient on high-dose steroids.	1
2553	Start the patient on statins, and do a biopsy to confirm.	1
2554	Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.	1
2555	Start treatment with steroids.	1
2556	Start what?	1
2557	Started with a condom, and we kept it going with our gloves and equipment.	1
2558	Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.	1
2559	Stay out of my business.	1
2560	Stay right there.	1
2561	Stay there.	1
2562	Stealing's all I know.	1
2563	Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL levels rise.	1
2564	Steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.	1
2565	Steve loved all that-- Sorry.	1
2566	Stevens-Johnson syndrome.	1
2567	Sticking around the whole time?	1
2568	Still could have done permanent damage.	1
2569	Still does a few orders from home.	1
2570	Still mad about what happened in the lab?	1
2571	Still nothing?	1
2572	Still there's only one way to settle this.	1
2573	Still.	1
2574	Stop being so.	1
2575	Stop me whenever you like.	1
2576	Stop telling the nurses I'm looking for a girlfriend.	1
2577	Stop there.	1
2578	Something very obvious and very boring.	1
2579	Something we think we know He did it.	1
2580	Something will turn up soon.	1
2581	Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it.	1
2582	Sometimes, the best way to connect with someone is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.	1
2583	Sometimes, you just don't get the job, but.	1
2584	See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.	1
2585	See, that would be an example.	1
2586	See, the beauty of the plan is that if it works, you think you can control me.	1
2587	See, the metaphors work.	1
2588	Seemed pretty upset.	1
2589	Seems healthy to me.	1
2590	Seems like someone's feeling better.	1
2591	Seems to have done you some good.	1
2592	Seizure activity?	1

2601	Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.	1
2602	Some nausea, dizziness, and as the tumor shrinks, there will be behavioral changes.	1
2603	Some other nut pulling a scalpel?	1
2604	Some people think it's burning now.	1
2605	some things come into focus.	1
2606	Some think it's quite a natural reaction.	1
2607	Some VIP visitor.	1
2608	Somebody call an ambulance! 	1
2609	Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?	1
2610	Someone broke your heart.	1
2611	someone who's related to you, does that empirically make them more special?	1
2612	Something happened that you were upset about?	1
2613	Release the best actors?	1
2614	Relevance.	1

2617	Remember?	1
2618	Reminded me of our St.	1

2654	Our patient woke up.	1
2655	Our patient's dying.	1
2656	Our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem.	1

2833	She wasn't even gonna leave her until I said that I was letting you off early.	1
2834	She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her.	1
2835	She went for it.	1
2836	She went out of her way to defy me! She needs--damn it, you should just fire her! My apologies.	1
2837	She will.	1
2838	She'd been helping to make the altar breads that morning, but no hard physical work or repetitive motion.	1
2839	She'd rather remember her like she is now.	1
2840	She'd spend all her money on pills.	1
2841	Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago.	1
2842	Sheldon's a.	1
2843	She'll be fine.	1
2844	She'll die without it.	1
2845	She's a good doctor.	1
2846	She's a homeless girl who's captain of the volleyball team.	1
2847	She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.	1
2848	She's a PhD in toxicology, right?	1
2849	She's already got neurological symptoms.	1
2850	She's an ex-florist.	1
2851	She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last ten years.	1
2852	She's determined not to do it again.	1
2853	She's feeling much better.	1
2854	She's giving up.	1
2855	She's gonna live.	1
2856	She's leading with her chin.	1
2857	She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.	1
2858	She's lying to compensate.	1
2859	She's moved on-- new hub, new kid.	1
2860	She's negative.	1
2861	She's not drinking the coffee either.	1
2862	She's not going to die.	1
2863	She's not long term because she has no long term.	1
2864	She's not married.	1
2865	She's not on any meds.	1
2866	She's not pregnant.	1
2867	She's not weird.	1
2868	She's not your girl, you idiot.	1
2869	She's not yours to fire.	1
2870	She's overwhelmed enough.	1
2871	She's perfectly fine-looking.	1
2872	She's responding well.	1
2873	She's smoking hot, and it's not his job to protect her marriage.	1
2874	She's Sophie.	1
2875	She's staying here.	1
2876	She's still sick.	1
2877	She's the crazy one.	1
2878	She's the only woman to ever do the catch a bullet trick.	1
2879	She's the same person who won't take my calls.	1
2880	She's throwing away her life because of blind faith.	1
2881	She's tired of living on the streets after all.	1
2882	She's vomiting.	1
2883	She's weird.	1
2884	She's writing my opening statement.	1
2885	She's your mom.	1
2886	She's your road not taken.	1
2887	Shh.	1
2888	Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.	1
2889	Shoot me.	1
2890	Shoot the dye.	1
2891	Short occlusion time of the artery, when the swelling goes down, you should.	1
2892	Should be out of here within the week.	1
2893	Should have clarified.	1
2894	Should we also add forgetfulness?	1
2895	Shouldn't have said anything.	1
2896	Shouldn't I use that money to do something important?	1
2897	Shouldn't we be trying to maximize what we can save here?	1
2898	Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment?	1
2899	Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.	1
2900	Shower.	1
2901	Showing weakness is what gets you killed.	1
2902	Shut up, you lying sack of crap.	1
2903	I have to live with this too.	1
2904	I have to send him to prison.	1
2905	I have to tell my wife the truth.	1
2906	I have two little boys.	1
2907	I have work to do.	1
2908	I haven't done a jugular line since my residency.	1
2909	I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch, much less run around trying to recruit nurses for yours.	1
2910	I haven't heard the name Bobby in a long time.	1
2911	I haven't left the hospital in four days.	1
2912	I haven't.	1
2913	I hear one of you thinks I'm a real bastard.	1
2914	I heard about a good new vegetarian place.	1
2915	I heard about your conversation with the patient's daughter.	1
2916	I heard he was sick.	1
2917	I heard the nurses talking.	1
2918	I heard you're on short time.	1
2919	I heard you're on that short time, House?	1
2920	I held the needle in front of the patient that set off his paranoia.	1
2921	I hitchhiked to Manhattan, moved in with an older guy.	1
2922	I hope it pays off.	1
2923	I hope it went terribly.	1
2924	I hope it works out for you.	1
2925	I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.	1
2926	I hope this isn't going where I assume it's going.	1
2927	I hope, one day, they'll understand that.	1
2928	I hung it up because someone had to run this place after cuddy left.	1
2929	I hurt Callie a lot.	1
2930	I just believe people are capable of more than you do, apparently.	1
2931	I just came for a chat with a friend.	1
2932	I just can't do this anymore.	1
2933	I just don't have the resources.	1
2934	I just don't know what to do.	1
2935	I just don't like it.	1
2936	I just don't want to indulge your-- Lupus.	1
2937	I just got so angry.	1
2938	I just got the Ed Wood box set.	1
2939	I just gotta do a standard battery of tests.	1
2940	I just haven't felt the calling yet.	1
2941	I just haven't found a way to make them interesting yet.	1
2942	I just know that I can't live my life feeling like we do.	1
2943	I just made you much, much worse.	1
2944	I just mean the part about the odds of it happening.	1
2945	I just need to see how far it goes.	1
2946	I just needed to create a distraction, though.	1
2947	I just said I don't feel anything.	1
2948	I just started back on the team.	1
2949	I just take vitamin C sometimes.	1
2950	I just turned 50.	1
2951	I just wanna be happy.	1
2952	I just want to do everything I can to protect my family.	1
2953	I just wanted to make sure you were cool if I go to without you.	1
2954	I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.	1
2955	I grabbed Park's ass.	1
2956	I grew up on Maui.	1
2957	I guess I'm supposed to be the good cop.	1
2958	I guess my minimum is just.	1
2959	I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.	1
2960	I guess that sounded.	1
2961	I guess that would be me.	1
2962	I guess that's it.	1
2963	I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you.	1
2964	I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.	1
2965	I guess, I mean-- yes, technically, I was thinking.	1
2966	I guess.	1
2967	I had a bad lawyer.	1
2968	I had a closed session hearing last week.	1
2969	I had a thought.	1
2970	I had a video interview with Chicago yesterday.	1
2971	I had a whole life planned.	1
2972	I had an affair.	1
2973	I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago.	1
2974	I had faith.	1
2975	I had it put in during the remodel last year.	1
2976	I had no choice.	1
2977	I had Sophie again last night and Ruby slept in my guest room, which has nothing to do with Phil, who will never be a father to my children.	1
2978	I had strep throat.	1
2979	I had the nails and eyebrows done, but that's it.	1
2980	I had to drop my kids off at day care across town.	1
2981	I had to get a job.	1
2982	I hadn't thought of that.	1
2983	I hardly know you.	1
2984	I hate conferences.	1
2985	I hate it when people say that.	1
2986	I have a chance to really watch it.	1
2987	I have a department to re-fund.	1
2988	I have a gift.	1
2989	I have a headache.	1
2990	I have a massive migraine.	1
2991	I have a patient who's asexual.	1
2992	I have Alzheimer's.	1
2993	I have an occasional beer with my friends.	1
2994	I have another one.	1
2995	I have diabetes.	1
2996	I have enough problems with this job.	1
2997	I have fun with you.	1
2998	I have fun.	1
2999	I have had second thoughts.	1
3000	I have Hepatitis C.	1
3001	I have no idea what flavor you are, so I decided to cover the spread.	1
3002	I have no idea what that second one stands for.	1
3003	I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.	1
3004	I dyed it back.	1
3005	I eat a lot of cheetos, I forget to wash my hands.	1
3006	I even did a complete MRI.	1
3007	I expect my people to lie better than that.	1
3008	I feel kinda badass.	1
3009	I feel like I'm in hell.	1
3010	I feel like you don't respect me.	1
3011	I feel stupid.	1
3012	I feel, uh, funny.	1
3013	I felt God's love, his grace.	1
3014	I felt like crying.	1
3015	I felt the calling.	1
3016	I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face, thus proving it's a natural response.	1
3017	I figure I could live off $25,000 a year.	1
3018	I forgive him.	1
3019	I found nodules.	1
3020	I found stains on his clothes.	1
3021	I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.	1
3022	I gave him a condom.	1
3023	I gave those away too.	1
3024	I gave you a good recommendation.	1
3025	I gave you time, Leeway, and you decided to do whatever the hell you wanted.	1
3026	I genuinely wonder who they belong to.	1
3027	I get four, and I give you two.	1
3028	I get it.	1
3029	I get that you're scared and guilty.	1
3030	I get why he wants to go to that fight.	1
3031	I give him the benefit of the doubt most of the time because I've seen what he can do.	1
3032	I got a call saying-- I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid.	1
3033	I got an order here to deactivate and remove his ankle monitor.	1
3034	I got copies.	1
3035	I got friends on the outside.	1
3036	I got it from the health fair I was working at.	1
3037	I got it.	1
3038	I got lucky.	1
3039	I got one final confession to make.	1
3040	I got sciatica, like my dad.	1
3041	I got something to do.	1
3042	I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees-- You know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.	1
3043	I got to get out of here, okay?	1
3044	I don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response, but, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's on Black Friday, I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.	1
3045	I don't think the world's coming to an end.	1
3046	I don't think we actually have much of a case.	1
3047	I don't trust you, House.	1
3048	How's he doing these days?	1
3049	How's he gonna learn if we stop his act?	1
3050	How's it coming?	1
3051	How's the chelation going?	1
3052	How's your patient?	1
3053	HPV was covered on the STD panel.	1
3054	I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.	1
3055	I didn't deserve it.	1
3056	I didn't do anything! Next time I will take your stereo! Ow! That was stupid.	1
3057	I didn't do it.	1
3058	I didn't even know you could do this! Start the blood thinners.	1
3059	I didn't hook them up yet.	1
3060	I didn't jump ship.	1
3061	I didn't put that there! You're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch! What?	1
3062	I didn't quit.	1
3063	I didn't say I changed.	1
3064	I didn't say it was wrong.	1
3065	I didn't say it was.	1
3066	I didn't say which side of the door he was on.	1
3067	I don't like gifts.	1
3068	I don't like owing people things.	1
3069	I don't like you.	1
3070	I don't need an A.B.G.	1
3071	I don't own a gun.	1
3072	I don't plan on being homeless forever.	1
3073	I don't really care about the movie.	1
3074	I don't remember anything.	1
3075	I don't see any bleeding in here.	1
3076	I don't see creed, color, pulse.	1
3077	I don't see how that's possible.	1
3078	I don't take charity.	1
3079	I don't think Emory wants to share right now.	1
3080	I don't think he can take it.	1
3081	I don't think he's a psych case.	1
3082	I don't think he's moving the company out of greed.	1
3083	I don't think it was anyone's fault.	1
3084	I don't think it was his fault.	1
3085	I don't think she's lying.	1
3086	I don't think so, no.	1
3087	I punched my attending.	1
3088	I ran away from home.	1
3089	I realize this is probably a rhetorical question-- why are you stealing my stuff?	1
3090	I remember everything.	1
3091	I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.	1
3092	I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.	1
3093	I run a diagnostic trial.	1
3094	I said don't interrupt.	1
3095	I said I was wrong.	1
3096	I said that I was.	1
3097	I said what else?	1
3098	I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid.	1
3099	I saved her from brain damage.	1
3100	I saw the boy who I was caring for.	1
3101	I say we put him out of his misery and bring out Emma's cake.	1
3102	I say we tell the kid.	1
3103	I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.	1
3104	I shot him in the head.	1
3105	I should be back on the road in a few minutes.	1
3106	I should be on six a day.	1
3107	I don't wanna come back to work for you.	1
3108	I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.	1
3109	I don't wanna start any rumors, but-- But what?	1
3110	I don't want to be lied to, and I can't live like that.	1
3111	I don't want to let House sabotage himself by sabotaging me, and I need your guidance and your trust to do that.	1
3112	I don't want to lie.	1
3113	I don't want to miss the opening bell.	1
3114	I don't want to needle the carotid.	1
3115	I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr.	1
3116	I don't want to validate his ridiculous theory.	1
3117	I have polycystic kidney disease.	1
3118	I have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts by husbands, wives, parents.	1
3119	I have staff searching.	1
3120	I have the skills to help people.	1
3121	I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.	1
3122	I have to find a place to live.	1
3123	I have to get to my car.	1
3124	I just--I just bumped into the wall.	1
3125	I just--I just got jostled a little, that's it.	1
3126	I just--I thought you were moody.	1
3127	I kept trying to talk to him, but before long, he'd forgotten, and he seemed.	1
3128	I killed my business partner.	1
3129	I knew House wouldn't take the case unless I ruled out anxiety.	1
3130	I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.	1
3131	I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday, and I saw everyone else move into the living room.	1
3132	I knew that she was the woman I wanted to marry.	1
3133	I knew this would fall on deaf ears, but I just kept talking and talking.	1
3134	I knew when he got out, I'd get my job back.	1
3135	I knew you could never do that to me.	1
3136	I knew you were very busy being vaguely important.	1
3137	I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment until you were certain I'd given up looking.	1
3138	I know about exit taxes.	1
3139	I know about your deal with Adams.	1
3140	I know he's talked about you.	1
3141	I know how to take someone's pain away, how to make a stopped heart beat again.	1
3142	I know how you operate.	1
3143	I know I have to pay attention to them.	1
3144	I know I'm not any good at being a clown yet, but when I do get a laugh and see those kids' eyes light up, that's how my dad made me feel when I was a kid.	1
3145	I know it feels strange.	1
3146	I know it.	1
3147	I know that look.	1
3148	I know that sounds weird, but.	1
3149	I know this is hard, and I'm sorry about your wife.	1
3150	I know this is hard, but please tell me exactly what happened next.	1
3151	I know this is tough.	1
3152	I know what killed your son.	1
3153	I know when House went to prison, you quit medicine.	1
3154	I know you didn't feel anything when you almost died.	1
3155	I know you disagree with-- Dad.	1
3156	I know you don't think I'm an idiot.	1
3157	I know you don't want me here, but, um.	1
3158	I know you object.	1
3159	I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.	1
3160	I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.	1
3161	I know you're the better diagnostician.	1
3162	I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.	1
3163	I know, I look bad.	1
3164	I know, I.	1
3165	I know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.	1
3166	I know, right?	1
3167	I know, which means you can't go either.	1
3168	I left because of his eyes.	1
3169	I left the room.	1
3170	I like it.	1
3171	I like my job, and I'm happy with my life.	1
3172	I like my nurses naughty.	1
3173	I like naval stuff.	1
3174	I like their oranges and lint.	1
3175	I like you.	1
3176	I live next to a Jewish frat.	1
3177	I live with them.	1
3178	I looked it up.	1
3179	I lost my job.	1
3180	I love him.	1
3181	I love my family.	1
3182	I love my husband, and I would not ever even for a second consider doing anything to hurt him.	1
3183	I love them more than anything, I just.	1
3184	I love them.	1
3185	I love you too.	1
3186	I love you.	1
3187	I loved him.	1
3188	I made a mistake, and now it's gonna end up ruining my life.	1
3189	I made it look like suicide.	1
3190	I made some calls.	1
3191	I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral.	1
3192	I may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications, it might be a good time to come clean to your son, let his father visit.	1
3193	I mean, do you think my father would have done that for ten minutes?	1
3194	I mean, even if you are right about it, why take your word over mine?	1
3195	I mean, he was closer to Callie than I was, and I missed him.	1
3196	I mean, he's constantly reminded of her.	1
3197	I mean, I hope to God I never have to use one.	1
3198	I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers.	1
3199	I mean, in the guest room.	1
3200	I mean, not-- not really.	1
3201	I mean, what am I supposed to do?	1
3202	I mean, you'll escalate, and then I'll retaliate, and the cycle will continue until we've both gone too far, at which point, I'll.	1
3203	I mean.	1
3204	I meant run away.	1
3205	I meant the kid.	1
3206	I mentioned it because.	1
3207	I met a TV producer at a dinner.	1
3208	I met a woman who likes her men well groomed.	1
3209	I met him at school.	1
3210	I might have cleared it with the cops.	1
3211	I might've missed that.	1
3212	I miss Claudine.	1
3213	I miss him too.	1
3214	I miss my wife, but it's not driving my decision-making.	1
3215	I miss them.	1
3216	I missed the fact that you were married.	1
3217	I missed you both so much.	1
3218	I moved back home because it was too drafty at the four seasons.	1
3219	I need $200,000.	1
3220	I need 20.	1
3221	I need a DNA sample.	1
3222	I need a few minutes to think.	1
3223	I need an intubation kit in here! What's going on?	1
3224	I need help with my patient.	1
3225	I need her out of my life.	1
3226	I need ideas.	1
3227	I need Insulin.	1
3228	I need it.	1
3229	I need more help.	1
3230	I need pressure.	1
3231	I need them.	1
3232	I need to be taken into protective custody.	1
3233	I need to DDx a patient with you.	1
3234	I need to examine your son.	1
3235	I need to feel like he loves me more than other people.	1
3236	I need to get a jump on this thing.	1
3237	I need to get away from House and everything that reminds me of him.	1
3238	I need to justify buying them.	1
3239	I need to prove I have the confidence to disobey him.	1
3240	I need to talk to mommy alone for a second.	1
3241	I need to talk to you and Phil.	1
3242	I need to think.	1
3243	I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.	1
3244	I need you to solve this, and I need you to do it without making me look like I can't control you.	1
3245	I need you to stop calling me.	1
3246	I need your advice.	1
3247	I need your help.	1
3248	I need.	1
3249	I needed that.	1
3250	I needed the cash, and, um, the locker was open.	1
3251	I never heard of a neurological problem that causes someone's skin to fall off.	1
3252	I never joke.	1
3253	I never meant to hurt my daughter.	1
3254	I never said that wasn't possible.	1
3255	I never went anywhere, did anything.	1
3256	I now accept, that your all better.	1
3257	I object to your cynicism.	1
3258	I only help those who can help myself.	1
3259	I only noticed because Chase was staring at them.	1
3260	I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here.	1
3261	I owe you.	1
3262	I own you.	1
3263	I paid Mr.	1
3264	I paid the price.	1
3265	I pay court-ordered child support, and, frankly, it's, uh.	1
3266	I pay you to think inside this room.	1
3267	I prepared the sarcophagus for you.	1
3268	I present.	1
3269	How do we explain the STD?	1
3270	How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the patient?	1
3271	How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?	1
3272	How do you expect to get into a good college?	1
3273	How do you know about ceftriaxone?	1
3274	How do you know about my first kid-- Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.	1
3275	How do you know she's happy?	1
3276	How do you know your boyfriend's okay?	1
3277	How do you mean?	1
3278	How do you work with a guy like that?	1
3279	How does briefly wishing I was screwed up make me screwed up?	1
3280	How does Dr.	1
3281	How does that sound?	1
3282	How does your ex-wife do it?	1
3283	How else do I compare them to other genetic disorders?	1
3284	How expensive?	1
3285	How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the man.	1
3286	How is that feeling?	1
3287	How long can I assume that he's been smoking?	1
3288	How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?	1
3289	How many do you want?	1
3290	How many more tricks do you got?	1
3291	How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial?	1
3292	How many times have you thrown the truth in people's faces?	1
3293	How much damage could you have?	1
3294	How much less?	1
3295	How old do you think I am?	1
3296	How sick is the patient?	1
3297	How soon is soon?	1
3298	How soon will they know if it's cancer?	1
3299	How the hell did I not see that?	1
3300	How the hell did we miss that?	1
3301	How was the Brazilian?	1
3302	How you doing?	1
3303	How you feeling?	1
3304	How?	1
3305	How'd the mom seem to you?	1
3306	How'd you even know to look for a tumor?	1
3307	How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?	1
3308	House's comments will, of course, have no bearing on this hearing.	1
3309	House's complete lack of concern is evidence of his deep concern?	1
3310	House's part, don't you think?	1
3311	House's process is dangerous, inappropriate.	1
3312	How about a viral syndrome?	1
3313	How about damage to her spinal cord blocking the signals from her genitals?	1
3314	How about I help you out?	1
3315	How about warmth?	1
3316	How about we don't believe she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?	1
3317	How about you drop it in your office?	1
3318	How about you have one of your peeps on the outside send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?	1
3319	How advanced is he?	1
3320	How are things between you and your wife?	1
3321	How are you doing?	1
3322	How are you feeling?	1
3323	How are you holding up?	1
3324	How are your feet?	1
3325	How bad is it?	1
3326	How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?	1
3327	How can he be hyper-sexual?	1
3328	How can he not be dead?	1
3329	How can I be pregnant if I've never even had sex?	1
3330	How can there be that much tissue.	1
3331	How can you be okay with this?	1
3332	How come she's not.	1
3333	How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.	1
3334	How could that possibly work as a tactic?	1
3335	How could the rest of us possibly understand?	1
3336	How could this be happening to my own daughter without me knowing it?	1
3337	How could this.	1
3338	How could you keep this from me?	1
3339	How did he die?	1
3340	How did he look?	1
3341	How did that turn out?	1
3342	How did you find that without a stethoscope?	1
3343	Higher or lower?	1
3344	Higher than most.	1
3345	Highly insensitive for sarcoid.	1
3346	High-stakes poker.	1
3347	Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?	1
3348	His assistant's name is Angie.	1
3349	His body temperature is rising.	1
3350	His body wasn't disposing of iron.	1
3351	His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk.	1
3352	His BP is dropping.	1
3353	His company's lost one third of its value since he was admitted.	1
3354	His company's moving him back to Portland.	1
3355	His daughter's sick.	1
3356	His E.	1
3357	His echocardiogram is negative for cardiomyopathy.	1
3358	His EKG, cardiac enzymes, and catheterization are all normal.	1
3359	His family history of melanoma may have affected his cellular outlook.	1
3360	His fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about GAD and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.	1
3361	His heart rate's finally elevating.	1
3362	His heart should start soon.	1
3363	His heart, liver, kidneys were all toast.	1
3364	His heartbeat's doing well, and his body temperature is stabilized.	1
3365	His house is not gonna be low priority.	1
3366	His ICP was not normal.	1
3367	His kidneys died, they transfused.	1
3368	His late father was a circus clown.	1
3369	His leg muscles are fine.	1
3370	His liver enzymes are slightly elevated.	1
3371	His liver was in shock before.	1
3372	His liver's not cleaning out his blood.	1
3373	His liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels.	1
3374	His lungs died.	1
3375	His mental status is declining.	1
3376	His mother feels it's better to do the test at a different hospital.	1
3377	His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.	1
3378	His paranoia started at least a year ago.	1
3379	His parents died young.	1
3380	His sclera's jaundiced.	1
3381	His son is dead.	1
3382	His symptoms have gone away.	1
3383	His symptoms will go away and then I can show him he was never sick.	1
3384	His thyroid levels were within normal range when he was admitted.	1
3385	His trachea wasn't swollen.	1
3386	His trachea's blocked below the incision point.	1
3387	His vision's back to normal, and if he remains asymptomatic through the night, we'll be able to release him in the morning.	1
3388	His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.	1
3389	Histoplasmosis?	1
3390	Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us.	1
3391	HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.	1
3392	Hmm.	1
3393	Hold his legs.	1
3394	Hold the analysis and help me save this thing.	1
3395	Holding your ass.	1
3396	Holy crap.	1
3397	Honey, I don't understand.	1
3398	Honey, I.	1
3399	Honey.	1
3400	Hooray for us.	1
3401	Hope you practiced the immaculate contraception.	1
3402	Hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	1
3403	Hopefully.	1
3404	Hoping everything else will come later.	1
3405	Hormone levels are normal.	1
3406	House actually presented the case in that way, or are you just trying to make him look bad?	1
3407	House can dance all over the rules, gets me knifed, and he gets a pass.	1
3408	House didn't even know he was coming back.	1
3409	House finally got you.	1
3410	House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?	1
3411	House has a point.	1
3412	House has established that that's okay in his world, or his prank war distracted you, or House makes medicine a game, and you just wanted to beat him.	1
3413	House has to believe that I have authority over him.	1
3414	House is a genius.	1
3415	House is also a fiasco.	1
3416	House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass.	1
3417	House is here and apparently prepping for an operation that will probably kill a patient.	1
3418	House is not the problem.	1
3419	House is obviously brilliant.	1
3420	House is screwing with you.	1
3421	House isn't gonna give up.	1
3422	House-- it's fake.	1
3423	House left a bottle of Vicodin to see if she'd steal it.	1
3424	House liked poking ant hills with a stick when he was a kid, and now he wants to do the same with us.	1
3425	House longer than anyone.	1
3426	House M.	1
3427	House not attach importance to patient histories?	1
3428	House noticed hormone levels in your blood, and consulted me as an oncologist.	1
3429	House on patient safety, Doctor, it is your duty to speak up.	1
3430	House ordered a therapeutic bath first to wash off any residual chemicals from the blast.	1
3431	House prefers chaos over cohesion.	1
3432	House pulled it out of nowhere.	1
3433	House S08E06 Parents By Mikhel for Subtitulos.	1
3434	House spoke to the wife.	1
3435	House thinks avoiding patients allows him to stay as objective as possible.	1
3436	House took your results after he manipulated you into providing them.	1
3437	House used to be a doctor.	1
3438	House was like the child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang.	1
3439	House won't go home.	1
3440	House! Mendelson! He's on 80 mg of Propranolol.	1
3441	House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a patient.	1
3442	House, don't.	1
3443	House, get away from him.	1
3444	House, House, just stop it.	1
3445	House, I worked for you for seven years.	1
3446	House, if it's total paralysis, he must have-- not necessarily.	1
3447	House, I'm starving.	1
3448	House, it's not a symptom.	1
3449	House, not now.	1
3450	House, open up.	1
3451	House, she really needs this kidney.	1
3452	House, stop.	1
3453	House, the nurses saw you come in.	1
3454	House, we gotta evacuate this area.	1
3455	House, welcome back.	1
3456	House, what are you doing?	1
3457	House, you're in here because you think you can do whatever you want whenever you want.	1
3458	I am the test.	1
3459	I am your boss.	1
3460	I am?	1
3461	I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really-- Oh, no, she could die.	1
3462	I asked him to meet me here for a family reunion.	1
3463	I assume you concur with the diagnosis.	1
3464	I assume you dosed the patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?	1
3465	I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job?	1
3466	I assume, from the silence, that Chase has had a Brazilian.	1
3467	I bet House $100 that I wouldn't get fired after my disciplinary hearing.	1
3468	I borrowed it from one of the nurses.	1
3469	I break a rule, no one gets hurt, but you kick me off my own case?	1
3470	I breathe it in my soul Is everything okay?	1
3471	I brought him in here under false pretenses.	1
3472	I brought it to your cell.	1
3473	I called him.	1
3474	I came to speak with Dr.	1
3475	I can assure you.	1
3476	I can barely look her in the eyes anymore.	1
3477	I can do anything.	1
3478	I can get the words out.	1
3479	I can get you out of here.	1
3480	I can refuse to see any visitor I want.	1
3481	I can think of easier ways to make 175 bucks a week.	1
3482	I can understand the rationalization.	1
3483	I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go.	1
3484	I can't ask someone to do that for me.	1
3485	I can't believe how stupid I've been.	1
3486	I can't believe I have cancer.	1
3487	I can't believe you did that.	1
3488	I can't comment on the drunk or the frat.	1
3489	I can't decide whether to take out an I told you so ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.	1
3490	I can't discuss any of that, not before the hearing.	1
3491	I can't do it.	1
3492	I can't drop it.	1
3493	I can't feel my arms.	1
3494	I can't feel my legs.	1
3495	I can't go back there! You may have a fungal infection.	1
3496	I can't justify buying video games and private schools when other people's children are starving.	1
3497	I can't let you move.	1
3498	I can't live in that home.	1
3499	I can't make you do that.	1
3500	I can't move my arm or leg.	1
3501	I can't pay you back.	1
3502	I can't take care of him anymore.	1
3503	I can't take my finger out.	1
3504	I can't think of another interpretation.	1
3505	I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes! Chase and Adams can do the test.	1
3506	Here we go.	1
3507	Here, come on.	1
3508	Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition.	1
3509	Here, you want this?	1
3510	Double shifts, just to keep the power on.	1
3511	Doubly interesting.	1
3512	Hi, Rollo.	1
3513	Hi, sis.	1
3514	Hurry up.	1
3515	Hurt a bit.	1
3516	Husband have her tonight?	1
3517	Hypnosis.	1
3518	Hypothetical-- if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?	1
3519	I accepted that.	1
3520	I actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes .	1
3521	I admire the creativity.	1
3522	I admit I was stuck, until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.	1
3523	I agree with her.	1
3524	Hey, how's my dad doing?	1
3525	Hey, keep your hands off my son.	1
3526	Hey, look, we'll adjust.	1
3527	Hey, maybe I don't have my father's crummy genes after all.	1
3528	Hey, Oscar.	1
3529	Hey, Stomper.	1
3530	Hey, take it easy.	1
3531	Hey, thanks for doing this in here.	1
3532	Hey, that is not okay.	1
3533	Hey, we both assaulted our bosses.	1
3534	Hey, we're having a conversation here.	1
3535	Hey, wha-- is that the infection?	1
3536	Good-bye.	1
3537	Got a case for you.	1
3538	Got a patient with end stage renal disease.	1
3539	Got a policy review meeting in here in five minutes.	1
3540	Got a problem with that, fire me.	1
3541	Got a PVC.	1
3542	Got him in here.	1
3543	Got House's phone.	1
3544	I didn't want a big, emotional scene.	1
3545	I didn't want the city to know about it.	1
3546	I didn't want you and the kids to worry.	1
3547	I didn't want you to think you needed medication.	1
3548	I didn't.	1
3549	I do have an imaginary colleague who's just sent me an imaginary page.	1
3550	I do this demonstration every year.	1
3551	I do, I can, I have.	1
3552	I don't believe that.	1
3553	I don't blame either one.	1
3554	I don't care how sick your spouse gets, you don't jump ship.	1
3555	I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.	1
3556	I don't care if we might need them.	1
3557	I don't care what killed him! It's called Alport syndrome.	1
3558	I don't care.	1
3559	I don't f.	1
3560	I don't feel very w.	1
3561	I don't have a boyfriend.	1
3562	I don't have a headache.	1
3563	I don't have time to teach you to act like one.	1
3564	I don't have to cough as much.	1
3565	I don't know how, but.	1
3566	I don't know how.	1
3567	I don't know if I'm coming back.	1
3568	I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right.	1
3569	I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.	1
3570	I don't know the history, but everyone makes mistakes.	1
3571	I don't know what it is.	1
3572	I don't know what kind.	1
3573	I don't know when I'm coming back.	1
3574	I don't know, I.	1
3575	I don't know, um, he.	1
3576	I ain't got a girlfriend in here.	1
3577	I ain't got no stereo.	1
3578	I almost died in that cell.	1
3579	I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room.	1
3580	I already lost one of them.	1
3581	I already told Foreman he'd been drinking that night.	1
3582	I also have kind eyes.	1
3583	I also have these.	1
3584	I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong.	1
3585	I also think that Taub has brought his little taubettes into work with him today.	1
3586	I also took $10,000 from the harvest scholarship fund, and I lost it gambling.	1
3587	I always wanted to believe.	1
3588	I am a cripple in need of assistance.	1
3589	I am a doctor.	1
3590	I am an equal opportunity exploiter.	1
3591	I am an opportunistic ex-con who just gave you a two-minute sob story as step three in my master plan, and you've offered me $1 million.	1
3592	I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.	1
3593	I am her daddy.	1
3594	I am not a reject.	1
3595	I am peep-less.	1
3596	I changed my mind.	1
3597	I cheated on Denise.	1
3598	I checked you out.	1
3599	I checked your file.	1
3600	I claim this burger in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain.	1
3601	I completely understand and almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine.	1
3602	I consider these grounds to be a holy place, and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.	1
3603	I could add some Mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.	1
3604	I could barely breathe.	1
3605	I could die.	1
3606	I could do $5,000.	1
3607	I could do a clotting test.	1
3608	I could feel better about that.	1
3609	I could have given you a Section 8.	1
3610	I could have you checked into a facility that exclusively treats mental disorders.	1
3611	I could live on dialyses for years.	1
3612	I could save four or five more lives.	1
3613	I couldn't resist.	1
3614	I couldn't tell you how many times she nearly O.	1
3615	I count 20.	1
3616	I custom-built this puppy.	1
3617	I cut a deal with the patient.	1
3618	I denied his request.	1
3619	I deserve respect.	1
3620	I deserved the slap.	1
3621	I did listen to you.	1
3622	I did one of them.	1
3623	I did pay for the room for the whole week, but.	1
3624	I did speak up.	1
3625	I did the same thing many times.	1
3626	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== as the new dean of medicine, I'd like to personally welcome all of our new employees and ask, why the hell do you want to come back?	1
3627	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== So how does a completely healthy teenager have a mini-stroke?	1
3628	escalate things somehow.	1
3629	Especially after years of following that much smaller third organ.	1
3630	Especially in a house with locked medicine cabinets.	1
3631	Especially since my husband died.	1
3632	Especially since you're short a team member.	1
3633	Especially since, with the extent of the emphysema, she needs a double lung.	1
3634	Ethics are not my strong suit.	1
3635	Even has a metaphor in it.	1
3636	Even if he didn't light up himself.	1
3637	Even if it was based on lies.	1
3638	Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.	1
3639	Even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.	1
3640	Even though I did.	1
3641	Even though there are three diagnoses?	1
3642	Even?	1
3643	Evening.	1
3644	Eventually, you will screw something up.	1
3645	Eventually, you'll pass boredom and get to bonding.	1
3646	Ever since then, he's been acting like he's actually trying to get me fired.	1
3647	Ever surf Kirra point?	1
3648	Every day.	1
3649	Every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection is time we could be treating him.	1
3650	Every time I see her, I say.	1
3651	Everybody doesn't lie, cheat, or steal from their friends.	1
3652	Everybody has to pay for their sins.	1
3653	Everybody looked up to me.	1
3654	Everybody loved me.	1
3655	Everybody makes mistakes.	1
3656	Everyone back at school is so worried about you.	1
3657	Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.	1
3658	Everyone had already refused to work on that case.	1
3659	Everyone keeps their jobs.	1
3660	Everyone loves fireworks.	1
3661	Everyone's covered.	1
3662	Everything has gone blue.	1
3663	Everything looks good.	1
3664	Everything's fine.	1
3665	Everything's shutting down.	1
3666	Everywhere but a job interview.	1
3667	Evil.	1
3668	Ew! Your neck looks really gross.	1
3669	Excellent deduction.	1
3670	Except for the again .	1
3671	Except for the annoying guilt about the husband.	1
3672	Except me.	1
3673	Except there's no blood.	1
3674	Excess adrenaline can cause heart problems and.	1
3675	Excuse me, but only family members are allowed.	1
3676	Excuse me, Your Honor, may I approach?	1
3677	Excuse me.	1
3678	Don't you guys think this is irresponsible?	1
3679	Don't you think it's a little early to be dragging up our baggage in front of each other?	1
3680	Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?	1
3681	Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings.	1
3682	Dr.Adams, would you please reach into my pants?	1
3683	Dr.Blackenshmurtz will accuse me of writing about the punch after the fact.	1
3684	Exoplanets.	1
3685	Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.	1
3686	Explains everything.	1
3687	Explains the bleeding.	1
3688	Explains the negatives of the blood disorder.	1
3689	Explains the neurological impairment as well as the normal blood work.	1
3690	Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.	1
3691	Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.	1
3692	Extreme altruism.	1
3693	Ex-wife.	1
3694	Factor 5 Leiden deficiency.	1
3695	fake an interest in them because you needed to, right?	1
3696	Fall in love, wanna be happy.	1
3697	Family gathering.	1
3698	Family members only during procedures.	1
3699	Family vacations kill.	1
3700	Family-owned and operated.	1
3701	Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.	1
3702	Feel free to jump in at any time.	1
3703	Feels like I'm missing something.	1
3704	Fever came on too fast.	1
3705	Fever's a little high, but it still fits.	1
3706	Filling up the tank.	1
3707	Find out what else he's lying about.	1
3708	Find out what killed him.	1
3709	Find out what's causing the meningitis.	1
3710	Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night.	1
3711	Fine enough to get back to work?	1
3712	Fine motor control is improving.	1
3713	Fine, then give me a team I don't have to put in quotation marks.	1
3714	Foreman?	1
3715	Foreman's gonna need a diagnostician.	1
3716	Foreman's not gonna back down.	1
3717	Forget about the bet.	1
3718	Forget nun, you slept with a patient?	1
3719	Forget that.	1
3720	Forget the nerves.	1
3721	Forging prescriptions?	1
3722	Former, to both.	1
3723	Fortunately, only the knife tip reached the cardiac muscle.	1
3724	Found her sleeping in the park.	1
3725	Found it in my office.	1
3726	Fourth.	1
3727	Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.	1
3728	Four-year-old kid.	1
3729	Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.	1
3730	Frankly, I feel violated.	1
3731	Freak out is a little strong.	1
3732	French vanilla, yeah.	1
3733	Fresh from the word I need you to drive me to a doctor.	1
3734	Fresh fruit in prison is usually chicken.	1
3735	Fresh plasma will replace the damaged red blood cells that are clogging his kidneys.	1
3736	Fridge has more spinach and broccoli than a farmer's market.	1
3737	From a corporation that's going through a very public belt-tightening.	1
3738	From ashes to ashes from dust to dust I found your stuff in storage.	1
3739	From Ben?	1
3740	From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act.	1
3741	From here who can we trust I wonder what happens now.	1
3742	from the E.	1
3743	From what I remember.	1
3744	From your ex-boss.	1
3745	Funded and staffed his own department.	1
3746	Funduscopic exam was normal.	1
3747	Fungal infection's off the table.	1
3748	Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.	1
3749	Finger paints?	1
3750	FiO2 is 93%-- Prison! Sorry I thought I heard everyone else think that.	1
3751	First 17 messages were cute, but-- I'm putting the band back together.	1
3752	First admit that I was right.	1
3753	First cousin's also a whiff.	1
3754	First off, be a decent, empathetic person.	1
3755	First patriotism, now loyalty.	1
3756	First up.	1
3757	Fits his physical symptoms.	1
3758	Fits perfectly.	1
3759	Fits the symptoms.	1
3760	Five days.	1
3761	Fix him.	1
3762	Flipd a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.	1
3763	Flout my authority, make the hospital look bad, back to jail.	1
3764	Fluconazole, right?	1
3765	Fluid?	1
3766	Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG.	1
3767	Followed your advice and took the night off.	1
3768	Following your brain is tough.	1
3769	Following your heart is easy.	1
3770	Foot color's good.	1
3771	For both our sakes.	1
3772	For either of us?	1
3773	For every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.	1
3774	For example, our opinions on mental illness.	1
3775	For example, you're looking at monkey DNA.	1
3776	For it to affect a pool of plasma.	1
3777	For ten years?	1
3778	For the massage bed.	1
3779	For the wrong diagnosis.	1
3780	For what I'm about to do.	1
3781	For what?	1
3782	Foreman is transferring our guy to Princeton General as soon as there's a bed available.	1
3783	Foreman warned us that you'd try something.	1
3784	Foreman will find out you're taking this case, and he'll bust you.	1
3785	Foreman! Clear.	1
3786	Foreman, members of the committee, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today, I.	1
3787	Foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard.	1
3788	Foreman, would you please reach under your chair?	1
3789	Greg.	1
3790	gret.	1
3791	Grr.	1
3792	Grrrrr! Okay.	1
3793	Guard! Dammit.	1
3794	Guard! You're going into anaphylactic shock.	1
3795	Guard.	1
3796	Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.	1
3797	Guess what kind of animal Wacky Benny's making now?	1
3798	Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.	1
3799	Guilt.	1
3800	guilt?	1
3801	Guilt-colored glasses.	1
3802	Guilty as charged.	1
3803	Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast.	1
3804	Guys, get your stuff.	1
3805	Ha ha ha! This is great.	1
3806	Had a meeting about a new parking validation system.	1
3807	Hail, hail, the gang's all here.	1
3808	Hair samples were clean.	1
3809	Half the time you bring your cars into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.	1
3810	Halfway through the perimetry exam, her tunnel vision went away.	1
3811	Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved.	1
3812	Hands behind your head! On the ground! You are so lucky.	1
3813	Happily married for ten years.	1
3814	Happy pranking.	1
3815	Hasn't even broken as much as a traffic law.	1
3816	Have Chase start him on steroids.	1
3817	Have I mentioned I don't trust the system?	1
3818	Have never cheated on you.	1
3819	have to move.	1
3820	Have to?	1
3821	Have you been having regular periods, Iris?	1
3822	Have you been married?	1
3823	Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?	1
3824	Have you considered sub-standard day care?	1
3825	Have you ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?	1
3826	Have you ever watched one of those?	1
3827	Have you gotten any strange letters or packages recently?	1
3828	Have you seen Bride of the Monster?	1
3829	Have you seen it?	1
3830	Have you sent the committee a character reference for me?	1
3831	Have your boyfriend give me those samples.	1
3832	Haven't heard an indirect order in here.	1
3833	Haven't read these.	1
3834	Haven't you heard?	1
3835	Having a family doesn't exempt me from social responsibility.	1
3836	He already said I was an ass.	1
3837	He also has a low red count.	1
3838	He also spiked a fever overnight.	1
3839	He also wants us to spy for him.	1
3840	He always has a plan.	1
3841	He always seemed so nice.	1
3842	He apologized.	1
3843	He asked for a personal day.	1
3844	He asked who you were.	1
3845	He ate a bag of peanuts, and peanut proteins would be.	1
3846	He barely said a couple of words and set the boy off.	1
3847	He beat you! What is it?	1
3848	He believes that disagreement and mistrust lead to better ideas.	1
3849	He broke his arm.	1
3850	He broke out with a rash right after I tested with the wheat-allergy swab, but none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.	1
3851	He came here last night.	1
3852	He came up with the figure, not me.	1
3853	He can fight this off if we give him a chance.	1
3854	He can walk out of here cured.	1
3855	He can't breathe.	1
3856	He can't function under someone's thumb.	1
3857	He can't keep them at his place.	1
3858	He can't say my kids until he lets me test them.	1
3859	He caught me with her, got me with a rake.	1
3860	He coached youth soccer.	1
3861	He collapsed while out jogging.	1
3862	He comes in with 11 straight knockout wins and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook was able to cut Rubio over the right eye in the tenth round of that last fight.	1
3863	He could do a lot of damage in there.	1
3864	He couldn't find a babysitter.	1
3865	He couldn't say zebra.	1
3866	He didn't get that name because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.	1
3867	He didn't have a rash.	1
3868	He didn't have one.	1
3869	He didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?	1
3870	He didn't understand and he didn't seem traumatized.	1
3871	He didn't.	1
3872	He died.	1
3873	He does.	1
3874	He doesn't have joint pain.	1
3875	He doesn't have one.	1
3876	He doesn't have photic epilepsy.	1
3877	He doesn't test positive for that either.	1
3878	He endangered Dr.	1
3879	He freaked out.	1
3880	He got in a fight.	1
3881	He got them playing flag football.	1
3882	He grabbed it, he apologized for grabbing it, and now he's taking classes because he grabbed it.	1
3883	He grabbed my behind.	1
3884	He had a bleeding problem earlier.	1
3885	He had a brain tumor.	1
3886	He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis.	1
3887	He had Drew's eyes.	1
3888	He has a heart problem but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.	1
3889	He has a lot more to lose than I do, and he knows that.	1
3890	He has a nodule in his thyroid.	1
3891	He has Alzheimer's! It's freezing outside, and he's sick! I mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?	1
3892	He has high-frequency hearing impairment.	1
3893	He has no choice.	1
3894	He has no heartbeat, and he's not breathing.	1
3895	He has no schistocytes in his smear.	1
3896	He has one pair of pants.	1
3897	He has Plummer's disease.	1
3898	He has stridor but no obstruction.	1
3899	He has to base his decisions on what's best for the entire hospital.	1
3900	He has to be professional.	1
3901	He hasn't asked me for anything.	1
3902	He hasn't changed.	1
3903	He hit you?	1
3904	He is an excellent doctor.	1
3905	He isn't gonna put himself back in jail over a dead kid.	1
3906	He just doesn't think being in the same room as the patient is crucial.	1
3907	He just got them a couple of weeks ago.	1
3908	He just held my hand.	1
3909	He just opened his eyes a little while ago.	1
3910	He just woke up.	1
3911	He keeps imagining symptoms, and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.	1
3912	He knew the answer.	1
3913	He lives in pennsauken under a different name, Mitchell Gordon.	1
3914	He lost his wife and kids because she couldn't stop giving money away.	1
3915	He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.	1
3916	He makes a living sending people to prison.	1
3917	He makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience.	1
3918	He may die from those wounds.	1
3919	He may just be shooting himself in the ankle.	1
3920	He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.	1
3921	He means it's not lemierre's, but it's still an infection, which is why it's spreading so rapidly.	1
3922	He must think that I hired him to attack.	1
3923	He needs a transplant.	1
3924	He needs to constantly establish he's the Alpha dog.	1
3925	He never eats or drinks anything that we haven't made at home.	1
3926	He never had melanoma.	1
3927	He obviously noticed something.	1
3928	He owns an arsenal.	1
3929	He played awesome as usual.	1
3930	He played poker.	1
3931	He probably would have taken other kids to the playground.	1
3932	He really needs to know his dad just breezed in and out of his life, drunk and incoherent?	1
3933	He really went after her.	1
3934	He said cryptically.	1
3935	He said he got them playing flag football.	1
3936	He said he understood completely and that I was fired.	1
3937	He said he was at work.	1
3938	He said it was okay.	1
3939	He said-- no, I'm talking about the jell-o.	1
3940	He said the work's been paid for.	1
3941	He said you walked out.	1
3942	He said you'd say that.	1
3943	He said, I've been working at this hospital for 15 years and I'm taking self-improvement classes.	1
3944	He saved my husband's life.	1
3945	He saved two lives.	1
3946	He sees competing debts with the same person as a disgrace to the game.	1
3947	He started vomiting again.	1
3948	He thinks three steps ahead, so I do too.	1
3949	He thought Taub's idea was stupid.	1
3950	He thought that was stupid too.	1
3951	He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.	1
3952	He told me had a few glasses of wine, and that he shouldn't do it, but he also said that you were good.	1
3953	He took it.	1
3954	He touched me first.	1
3955	He trained for a marathon once.	1
3956	He tried but.	1
3957	He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer.	1
3958	He used to call him deezer.	1
3959	He used to wear those stupid things all the time.	1
3960	He walked right up to me.	1
3961	He wandered out of the sandbox into the street, into the path of a moving car.	1
3962	He wanted to check on me.	1
3963	He wants me to change my visitation order so he can ask Rachel and my daughter to move out west with him.	1
3964	He wants to relive this.	1
3965	He wants to, yeah.	1
3966	He wants you.	1
3967	He was a character in the Flintsteins.	1
3968	He was an athlete.	1
3969	He was an only child.	1
3970	He was getting revenge for the orange hair and rigged it in House's office.	1
3971	He was given fluids, and he got better.	1
3972	He was giving me a ride home, and.	1
3973	He was in a jostle.	1
3974	He was negative.	1
3975	He was not doing cocaine.	1
3976	He was okay with that?	1
3977	He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans.	1
3978	He was saying that things had been better lately between him and I, that I was happier.	1
3979	He was sitting at his desk.	1
3980	He was the only boy that liked me.	1
3981	He wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.	1
3982	He wasn't trying to pull anybody away.	1
3983	He won't even need surgery.	1
3984	He wouldn't even ce to the door a second time.	1
3985	He yelled at you for letting me see the file?	1
3986	He?	1
3987	Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal.	1
3988	Head CT showed no signs of stroke or hemorrhage.	1
3989	Healed, thank you.	1
3990	Hear the difference?	1
3991	Heard your arm's healing nicely.	1
3992	Heart attack while he was on Interferon rules out encephalitis, but I still think I'm right about the neural symptoms.	1
3993	Heart rate's 140, pressure's dropping.	1
3994	Heart rate's only 90.	1
3995	Heart, lungs.	1
3996	Heartbroken.	1
3997	Heather Sweeney.	1
3998	He'd have his own words for everything.	1
3999	He'd have localized pain.	1
4000	He'd never admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you.	1
4001	He'd want to get out of the wind.	1
4002	Heh.	1
4003	He'll back down.	1
4004	He'll be able to go home in a few days.	1
4005	He'll be even more motivated to beat you.	1
4006	He'll bleed.	1
4007	He'll notice it eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.	1
4008	He'll probably die of boredom long before that.	1
4009	He'll ruin my career.	1
4010	He'll thank us.	1
4011	He'll wake up in an hour.	1

4079	Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.	1

4122	He's obviously paranoid.	1
4123	He's on bypass.	1
4124	He's on Heparin and stable for now, but this could put him at risk for stroke or embolism.	1
4125	He's only guessing.	1
4126	He's probably not eating all that healthy.	1

4165	Getting some ectopy.	1
4166	Getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board.	1
4167	Gift certificate.	1
4168	Girl says, yeah, me too.	1
4169	Girl who doesn't want anything from a stranger is crazy.	1
4170	Girl.	1
4171	Girlfriend might not be so bad.	1
4172	Girls, do lab tests.	1
4173	Good question.	1
4174	Good thing you made it all official.	1
4175	Good things usually happen.	1

4192	Grab a consent form.	1
4193	Great idea.	1
4194	Great ideas, if dengue fever or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly.	1
4195	Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up.	1
4196	Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.	1
4197	Hereditary angioedema or systemic mastocytosis could mimic anaphylaxis.	1

4199	Here's some lube.	1

4243	He's got Alzheimer's.	1
4244	He's got everything he needs.	1
4245	He's got his office back.	1

4255	He's in there.	1
4256	He's in togood of shape.	1
4257	He's just more comfortable working with me because he's known me longer.	1
4258	He's just stupid.	1
4259	He's just taken up performing and it's very stressful for him.	1
4260	He's late for a trashcan fire.	1
4261	He's lying, not just Taub.	1
4262	He's moving his company to China, and his employees are hanging him in effigy.	1
4263	He's moving it out of grief.	1
4264	He's my husband.	1
4265	He's never gonna know.	1
4266	He's never hit her before or lost all his English.	1

4276	both celibate.	1
4277	Both seems excessive.	1
4278	Both your kids are named.	1
4279	Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom, it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.	1
4280	Bounding, four-plus.	1
4281	Boy meets girl, girl falls for boy, boy says, I'm asexual.	1
4282	Boys, do a home search.	1

4289	Bring her in and pack her nose.	1
4290	Brother against brother.	1
4291	Brown Vestments means you're Carmelites, cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.	1

4294	bully her.	1
4295	Bunch of failed relationships.	1
4296	Bunch of his high school buddies.	1
4297	Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving, but not this fast.	1
4298	Burkitt's lymphoma.	1
4299	Burn cream would drown him faster than water.	1
4300	Burned his lungs, which is why he coughed up blood.	1
4301	Bus pass, thrift stores.	1
4302	Busting a move in a night club.	1
4303	But a girl has needs.	1
4304	But a shotgun is not gonna work.	1
4305	But ability isn't always enough.	1
4306	But absolution?	1
4307	But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.	1
4308	But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.	1
4309	But anything you can remember might help save his life.	1
4310	But better.	1
4311	But Chang and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam.	1
4312	But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point.	1
4313	But daddy is weak and needs to know.	1
4314	But daddy's boss is what we call a jackass.	1
4315	But delightful, all the same.	1
4316	But-- Do what Park says.	1
4317	But don't worry-- it's not gonna end here.	1
4318	But Dr.	1
4319	But each time, it's just the best.	1
4320	But every unit of plasma can have up to 25 contributing donors.	1
4321	But family comes first.	1
4322	But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.	1
4323	But he is effective.	1
4324	But he makes us all better.	1
4325	But he needed an excuse.	1
4326	But he never had the power to overrule me.	1
4327	But he was right.	1
4328	But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.	1
4329	But he's really excited about representing me.	1
4330	But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee.	1
4331	But House doesn't and I don't, so you can wait till he camps out on your parents' lawn or you can admit you don't live on some higher plane and thank me later.	1
4332	But House found it.	1
4333	But how can you not be traumatized?	1
4334	But I can't live like this.	1
4335	But I didn't mean physical stress.	1
4336	But I didn't want to, and he got mad.	1
4337	But I don't think that's gonna change your opinion, because.	1
4338	But I hadn't had sex in years.	1
4339	But I knew.	1
4340	But I know that all of you know him as the guy that owns the only gas station in town.	1
4341	But I know you.	1
4342	But I need to ask you favor.	1
4343	But I need to see down your barrel.	1
4344	But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it.	1
4345	But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.	1
4346	But if it'll get me the file.	1
4347	But if it's completely clotted, it may indicate cancer.	1
4348	But if there's no boyfriend, where did the bruises come from?	1
4349	But if we can wake up and learn that the entire bank system has gone bankrupt overnight, it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk.	1
4350	But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.	1
4351	But if you feel the need to manipulate me to make me feel useful, then yes.	1
4352	But if you want to.	1
4353	But if your get-House-out-of-jail-free experiment blows up in your face, it's not my job to get you out of it.	1
4354	But if you're having doubts about Chicago, I can call them back.	1
4355	But I--I wasn't on.	1
4356	But I'm assuming Dr.	1
4357	But I'm glad it's going to someone.	1
4358	But I'm not-- I'm not an alcoholic.	1
4359	But it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.	1
4360	But it ends, like, three feet further over.	1
4361	But it must've been important that you stayed for both of them.	1
4362	But it's a perfect time if you're a member of my team.	1
4363	But it's definitely on the wish list.	1
4364	But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to.	1
4365	but it's possible.	1
4366	But it's related to medicine.	1
4367	But it's theorized.	1
4368	But I've given up red meat.	1
4369	But I've got two, and this woman has none.	1
4370	But I've never seen you use rosary beads.	1
4371	But just do whatever you have to do to get over this.	1
4372	But let me be clear-- you mouth off to one guard, we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell, you break any rules I don't even remember, you can park your ass here for four more months.	1
4373	But like pouring water on a fire, that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash which made his immune system overcompensate.	1
4374	But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time.	1
4375	But maybe the old paint did.	1
4376	But my department got defunded, and.	1
4377	But not guilty enough to stop seeing her.	1
4378	But not his swollen lymph notes.	1
4379	But not just there, um.	1
4380	But now that I accept that, I feel much less conflicted.	1
4381	But now?	1
4382	But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs.	1
4383	But one of the only things that I can feel okay about is that I never hit her.	1
4384	But Orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night.	1
4385	But reaction to meds could.	1
4386	But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.	1
4387	But she can.	1
4388	But some are physiological, and others are psychological.	1
4389	But technically it will still pay off.	1
4390	But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here.	1
4391	But that'll destroy the good lung too.	1
4392	But that's as low as I'm gonna go.	1
4393	But that's not the idea House went with.	1
4394	But that's only experimental.	1
4395	But that's what white blood cells are.	1
4396	But the kid never smoked.	1
4397	But the steroids would have treated for that.	1
4398	But then these two believe that the policy of protecting American jobs starts at home.	1
4399	But then you'll get out, and unlike you.	1
4400	But there is thickening in the lining of the wall of the third ventricle.	1
4401	But there's always a chance we can't.	1
4402	But these things take time.	1
4403	But they need it more than people with TB or children in Indonesia with no eyes?	1

4414	but we infer their existence because of the effect they have on the star they orbit.	1
4415	But we went over the plans together.	1
4416	But we wound up finding something.	1
4417	But we'll get through this.	1
4418	But we're on a clock.	1
4419	But we've moved out.	1
4420	But what about compromising it in a minor way?	1
4421	But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?	1
4422	But when Drew died.	1
4423	But when I was told the patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.	1
4424	But when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.	1
4425	But when you think about the consequences-- Okay, let's go.	1
4426	But why don't you assume no recent meds?	1
4427	But you agree that empathy is a useful quality for doctors?	1
4428	But you already promised it to someone else.	1

4441	But, out of an abundance of caution, my colleague has taken it upon herself to do one more test.	1
4442	But, uh, thank you.	1
4443	But, well, if it was something in the water, it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?	1
4444	But, yes, you're right.	1
4445	Can't be, bilirubin's normal.	1
4446	Can't change what happened.	1

4468	'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives.	1
4469	'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.	1
4470	'Cause if he admits he was in a fight, then he goes to the hole.	1
4471	'Cause if it's the same as yesterday you know I'm out just so you know because, because our paths, they cross Dad.	1
4472	'Cause I'm firing her myself.	1
4473	'Cause I'm hurting him.	1
4474	'Cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time - Hey.	1
4475	'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering.	1
4476	'Cause I'm right here, you dick.	1
4477	'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something.	1
4478	'Cause I'm vain and shallow.	1
4479	'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.	1

4481	'Cause it's gonna end badly.	1
4482	'Cause my boss says he doesn't have the money.	1
4483	'Cause next, it'll be three cases, then four.	1
4484	'Cause nothing's happened.	1
4485	'Cause that doctor didn't believe you?	1
4486	'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a.	1
4487	'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.	1

4866	Doc, what ya need?	1
4867	Doctors Adams and Park.	1
4868	Doctors can be degenerates.	1
4869	Doctor's right about that.	1

4915	Am I right, Emory?	1
4916	Am I weird?	1
4917	Amoxicillin.	1
4918	An affair?	1
4919	An allergic reaction.	1
4920	An entire hospital betting on the legitimacy of my kids?	1
4921	An insignificant token.	1
4922	An intact immune system.	1
4923	An understandable mistake.	1
4924	An untreated schizoid disorder he's finally lost the ability to suppress.	1
4925	Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.	1
4926	Anasarca?	1

4929	And a lot of people owe me wedding gifts.	1
4930	And air freshener.	1
4931	And alkalinize his urine.	1
4932	And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.	1
4933	And amusing myself at your expense.	1
4934	And an allergic reaction wouldn't get worse three days after he was admitted.	1
4935	And Andrews is a hack.	1
4936	And any minor infection could have caused those.	1
4937	And ate biscuits.	1
4938	And beer.	1
4939	And by money, you mean all your money.	1
4940	And by we, you mean you.	1
4941	And by you, I mean me.	1
4942	And Chase being cagey in general.	1
4943	And Chase brought a scalpel in there.	1
4944	And check Chase for testosterone.	1
4945	And check with admitting for the net worth of all new patients.	1
4946	And come down come down innocent way of life Bikes go faster without training wheels.	1
4947	And completely divorced from humanity.	1
4948	And could, but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes.	1
4949	And do an upper endoscopy to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison, after mommie dearest has given her permission.	1
4950	And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?	1
4951	And don't even pretend like you're not relieved.	1
4952	And Dr.House is sure that's what she has?	1
4953	And during about nine years of previous cases.	1
4954	And even if it did, they'd blame themselves for the rest of their lives too.	1
4955	And even if someone wanted to poison him, I don't see how they would do it.	1
4956	And every night.	1
4957	And everyone else just went along with this?	1
4958	And extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.	1
4959	And find something.	1
4960	And get the real story on clown, senior's death.	1
4961	And glutes.	1
4962	And great vests.	1
4963	And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.	1
4964	And he seemed happy and he seemed normal.	1
4965	And he told me I should leave.	1
4966	And he was all, 'cause of how Diaz kicked his ass last month.	1
4967	And he was just the first.	1
4968	And her shoulder pain is all gone.	1
4969	And here's a bigger one.	1
4970	And he's always self-destructive.	1
4971	And he's rich.	1
4972	And he's right.	1
4973	And his urine and blood tests didn't show any evidence of an adrenaline-secreting tumor.	1
4974	And how did these orange smudges get on the patient files?	1
4975	And how exactly is that my fault?	1
4976	And I am not ready to give up this.	1
4977	And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.	1
4978	And I barely even have $100 and.	1
4979	And I do mean rule out.	1
4980	And I don't own a gun.	1
4981	And I don't want your help.	1
4982	And I knew that meant making certain sacrifices.	1
4983	And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are.	1
4984	And I look forward to working with you as well.	1
4985	And I lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead child.	1
4986	And I mean that metaphorically, of course.	1
4987	And I need a transplant, and they say I don't have much time, so when I heard that you were willing, I just.	1
4988	And I suspect that you've spent every minute since this has happened trying to answer that very question.	1
4989	And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr.	1
4990	And I think that's great.	1
4991	And I told you I wasn't listening.	1
4992	And I want to let you know wanted to see how you were.	1
4993	And I was all, how come?	1
4994	And I was the one who questioned her, so, if there was an oversight, it was mine.	1
4995	And I will pay you not to go to anger management classes.	1
4996	And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.	1
4997	And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.	1
4998	And if he's suspended as a result of this hearing, he violates his parole and he goes back.	1
4999	And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right.	1
5000	And if it doesn't start?	1
5001	And if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.	1
5002	And if it is?	1
5003	And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.	1
5004	And if it's not a clot?	1
5005	And if she says she has been vaccinated?	1
5006	And if they find out it was me, I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.	1
5007	And if we induce v-fib, odds say that we'll be able to revive him.	1
5008	And if you do it long enough, it becomes real?	1
5009	And if you live?	1
5010	And I'll take Park.	1
5011	And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.	1
5012	And I'm not acting out.	1
5013	And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.	1
5014	And I'm not one of them.	1
5015	And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag.	1
5016	And I'm sorry, but.	1
5017	And I'm sure your tests have come up negative, or you would have shut me up already.	1
5018	And it feels good.	1
5019	And it only has 12 hours left.	1
5020	And it was too hard.	1
5021	And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better.	1
5022	And it's not a fight.	1
5023	And it's not in the pool.	1
5024	And it's still his company.	1
5025	And it's your job.	1
5026	And I've been a lousy mom.	1
5027	And knock him out.	1
5028	And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.	1
5029	And maybe starting to go away.	1
5030	And me?	1
5031	And men love commitment-free sex.	1
5032	And mom's a selfish jerk.	1
5033	And mom's determination to keep dad away, even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.	1
5034	And mother is an abbreviation.	1
5035	And MS and vasculitis usually get better with pregnancy.	1
5036	And much as I'd love to hear you contradict me, I have a 7:30 appointment to explore my intimacy issues at La Scala.	1
5037	And my money clip.	1
5038	And Mykonos.	1
5039	And neither has the job, right?	1
5040	And neither should you.	1
5041	And no one in town is ever gonna speak to me again.	1
5042	And nothing seems to help.	1
5043	And now everybody's talking about it.	1
5044	And now that she's a teenager, it's gotten worse.	1
5045	And now there's still something wrong with me.	1
5046	And now you don't?	1
5047	And now you're gonna tell me you didn't.	1
5048	And old team for the win! Not that I'm keeping score.	1
5049	And on a personal note, if my actions caused anyone distress, I sincerely apologize.	1
5050	And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait.	1
5051	And people change.	1
5052	And rust means Arsenic.	1
5053	And scene.	1
5054	And she needs an LVAD.	1
5055	And she was nagging you about finding a husband.	1
5056	And she'll feel that way, right up until things get too tough and she has to start using again.	1
5057	And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo.	1
5058	And so did Drew.	1
5059	And so is this.	1
5060	And Social Services.	1
5061	And some of you may know him as the treasurer of our harvest scholarship fund.	1
5062	And somehow, you managed to con her into hanging around.	1
5063	and T.	1
5064	And taking Oxy just.	1
5065	And that haircut isn't helping, either.	1
5066	And that is exactly what happened.	1
5067	And that probably leaves you as former Dean of Medicine.	1
5068	And that was supposed to be the end of it.	1
5069	And that you were the reason.	1
5070	And that's from a guy with one alimony and two child support payments.	1
5071	And that's just some of the lies from the last minute.	1
5072	And that's not a bullet.	1
5073	And that's significant why?	1
5074	And that's what you took away from this situation?	1
5075	And that's why I went to Dr.Foreman.	1
5076	And that's why men always marry their right hands.	1
5077	And the eighth?	1
5078	And the Nth?	1
5079	And the nurses love you.	1
5080	And the pericardial inflammation.	1
5081	And the pregnancy.	1
5082	And the seventh?	1
5083	And the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.	1
5084	And the tox screen was clean.	1
5085	And the wife?	1
5086	And then go back to sneaking around behind his back?	1
5087	And then I could donate my other organs.	1
5088	And then I met you.	1

5196	All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out.	1
5197	All right, fine, clever.	1
5198	All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.	1
5199	All right, I'll take the other ticket.	1
5200	All right, now go to work, House.	1
5201	All right, this is getting annoying.	1
5202	All right, we need you to sit back and try to relax.	1
5203	All right, what?	1
5204	According to Foreman, they're only for DDxing people who are still alive.	1
5205	According to my calendar, I'm a week early.	1
5206	According to this article, at least.	1
5207	Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.	1
5208	Actually there's two, but we don't have enough jell-o for the first.	1
5209	Actually you have to.	1
5210	Actually, it was my idea.	1
5211	Actually, it's something that comes up often.	1
5212	Actually, it's your mom's decision.	1
5213	Actually, the difference is pretty much $1 million.	1
5214	Actually, there's two.	1
5215	actually, why didn't I do that?	1
5216	Acute etoh ingestion could have-- hey, paint around them! Who's painting?	1
5217	Acute onset points to tularemia.	1
5218	Adams is free.	1
5219	Adams is right.	1
5220	Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.	1
5221	Adams or Dr.	1
5222	Adams! They're gonna revoke your parole.	1
5223	Adams, he endangered himself, and he endangered the patient.	1
5224	Advanced enough, but no IV feedings.	1
5225	Aerosolized Heparin might.	1
5226	Aerosolized Heparin.	1
5227	After 12 years, the active infection would have died down everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests.	1
5228	After having been rejected explains the clothes.	1
5229	After he broke out, I wanted to confirm it was gluten before we dosed him.	1
5230	After he lost his son, he lost his job.	1
5231	After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.	1
5232	After mom, I had nothing left.	1
5233	After what happened to you, don't you wanna remake your life?	1
5234	After you admit it.	1
5235	After you'd administered the Heparin, I see there was a discharge order on the chart, and yet the patient never left.	1
5236	Afternoon?	1
5237	Again, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's.	1
5238	Again, why does it matter?	1
5239	Again.	1
5240	Agh! Oh, that is too bad.	1
5241	Ah, Dr.	1
5242	Ah, explains the hole in this chair.	1
5243	Ah, great.	1
5244	Ah, here we go.	1
5245	Ah, let me guess.	1
5246	Ah, mm, yeah, actually.	1
5247	Ah, shut it off! Apparently we're allowed to do this now.	1
5248	Are you real or just something from wanderlust who can you trust when tears we flower House.	1
5249	Are you really leaving medicine?	1
5250	Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr.	1
5251	Are you saying I'm crazy?	1
5252	Are you saying it's.	1
5253	Are you saying that because you believe it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?	1
5254	Are you sorry about what you did?	1
5255	Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing in his office?	1
5256	Are you sure there's no one on the father's side of the family?	1
5257	Are you sure you don't want to start over?	1
5258	Are you telling me you didn't care?	1
5259	Are you thinking that maybe-- what?	1
5260	Are you trying to annoy us?	1
5261	Are you trying to make this easy for me?	1
5262	Are you trying to prove that I was distracted, that my judgment was compromised?	1
5263	Are your ears ringing?	1
5264	Aren't surfing enough.	1
5265	Aren't there actual medical tests?	1
5266	Aren't we?	1
5267	Aren't you supposed to be pointing a finger at your own life as a cautionary tale?	1
5268	Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice to maximize their niceness?	1
5269	Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.	1
5270	arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors.	1
5271	Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and, yes, mental changes.	1
5272	Arrhythmias are gone.	1
5273	Arrhythmia's back.	1
5274	Arterial pulse is good.	1
5275	As far as we know.	1
5276	as far as you can prove.	1
5277	As for Santos, his handlers tell us that he's done more roadwork than at any time in his career, hoping to prove tonight that he can box for 12 full rounds.	1
5278	As I was saying, Dr.	1
5279	As in routine vaccines against stuff that is actually scary.	1
5280	As it grew larger, so did the confessions.	1
5281	As long as I don't hear it directly from her, then I can hang on to hope that it's not true.	1
5282	As long as I keep bringing her muffins.	1
5283	As long as we find something.	1
5284	As long as you keep dealing with your doubts in the same way then.	1
5285	As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here.	1
5286	As opposed to being right?	1
5287	As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead man.	1
5288	As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.	1
5289	As soon as you leave, I am.	1
5290	Ascending colangitis.	1
5291	Ask Taub.	1
5292	Aspirin in adults is a reach.	1
5293	Assumed you have a huge penis?	1
5294	Assuming I got lost, twice.	1
5295	Assuming, of course, we are talking about House.	1
5296	Asthma or something.	1
5297	Asthma-induced pneumothorax would and might not show up on a posteroanterior X-ray.	1
5298	Asystole in the E.	1
5299	At first, I thought it might be frostbite, but I haven't really been out in the cold.	1
5300	At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon.	1
5301	At least a month.	1
5302	At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.	1
5303	At least he thinks he did.	1
5304	At least his white blood cells were special.	1
5305	At least I have principles.	1
5306	At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily.	1
5307	At least I wish I would.	1
5308	At least I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.	1
5309	At least it wouldn't be so annoying to watch.	1
5310	At least tell me you haven't been drinking today.	1
5311	At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did because we're not doing anything.	1
5312	At least you two have that in common.	1
5313	At least, that's what I've been told.	1
5314	At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?	1
5315	At that moment, he could only stay alive as long as my finger plugged the hole.	1
5316	At the time, it seemed-- - Oh, let me guess.	1
5317	At the time, it seemed like a good idea.	1
5318	At this point, being he makes you feel better.	1
5319	At this rate, I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.	1
5320	Atropine poisoning.	1
5321	Autonomic dysregulation syndrome.	1
5322	Autonomic dysregulation.	1
5323	Aw, that is cute.	1
5324	Awkward! He knocked up two different women at the same time.	1
5325	Baby.	1
5326	Back door.	1
5327	Back home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos.	1
5328	Back off! Oh, God.	1
5329	Bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus.	1
5330	And then when you got tired of being a rebel, you just went home.	1
5331	And then.	1
5332	and there ain't no one Bye, House.	1
5333	And there it is.	1
5334	And there's no way I'm leaving him here unsupervised.	1
5335	And there's your new team.	1
5336	And these ones were right.	1
5337	And they don't dislike me.	1
5338	And they were, in fact, twins.	1
5339	And this means a lot to me.	1
5340	And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea.	1
5341	And those were your exact words?	1
5342	And to wipe that out, you need special ops.	1
5343	And we're walking, we're walking.	1
5344	And what about your idea?	1
5345	And what if I have a kid?	1
5346	And what's brown mean?	1
5347	And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.	1
5348	And when did he learn that?	1
5349	And when I make more, I'll give that way too.	1
5350	And when I remember.	1
5351	And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something.	1
5352	And when you do, I'm gonna take you to puerto escondido.	1
5353	And where's Chase?	1
5354	And why are you asking me about it?	1
5355	And why did House think that was stupid?	1
5356	And yet it happens.	1
5357	And yet you hit her.	1
5358	And yet your first thought was frostbite?	1
5359	And you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.	1
5360	And you can tell Taub that he's gonna get the same treatment as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.	1
5361	And you can't know because you can't think clearly about her.	1
5362	And you failed.	1
5363	And you know him as well as I do.	1
5364	And you know why?	1
5365	And you never would have operated on her after.	1
5366	And you said I wouldn't be able to help it.	1
5367	And you said the Devils won?	1
5368	And you should update your resume.	1
5369	And you tested her-- see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.	1
5370	And you two.	1
5371	And you want to do some insider trading?	1
5372	And you want to take that away?	1
5373	And you weren't before?	1
5374	And you won't be able to prove anything.	1
5375	And you?	1
5376	And you'll never get her consent.	1
5377	And your collective vomiting.	1
5378	And your eyes-- the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.	1
5379	And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological-- Your parents didn't love you enough.	1
5380	And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing?	1
5381	And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail-- That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun.	1
5382	And you're a super-duper audience.	1
5383	And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun.	1
5384	And you're here in my heart Like when I gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.	1
5385	And you're not sure if he has brain damage from being frozen.	1
5386	And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?	1
5387	And you're sure he didn't leave until after 9:00?	1
5388	And yours what?	1
5389	And you've always-- What's that from?	1
5390	And, Adams.	1
5391	And, for the first time, she's acting like it.	1
5392	And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that.	1
5393	And, most important, hence the anger.	1
5394	Blackbird has spoken like the first bird What's wrong?	1
5395	blame me.	1
5396	Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.	1
5397	Blockage?	1
5398	Blood chemistry showed high ammonia.	1
5399	Blood clot.	1
5400	Blood count and protein count are normal.	1
5401	Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off.	1
5402	Blood in his urine.	1
5403	Blood smear was clear, and we idiots treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.	1
5404	Blood work shows high levels of prolactin.	1
5405	Blood work was negative for HIV.	1
5406	Blood, urine, eeg.	1
5407	Blue Veil means you're a postulant, haven't taken your vows yet.	1
5408	Blues and Greens.	1
5409	Bob Harris, get on up here with that beautiful family of yours! Bob Harris, folks! Bob, your community activism, charity work, and character represent the finest Cedarville has to offer.	1
5410	Bob, one of my shoes is missing from my locker.	1
5411	Bob?	1
5412	Bobby is an incredibly fun, great guy.	1
5413	Bobby was very insistent on that point.	1
5414	Bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms.	1
5415	Book a procedure room.	1
5416	Boo-yah! Pfft! Boo-yah to you too.	1
5417	Boredom is not transmissible.	1
5418	Boring! I'm sorry.	1
5419	Been in and out of rehab, ve up clowning.	1
5420	Been in surgery.	1
5421	Been used in sheep.	1
5422	Been working for House for two weeks.	1
5423	Before I ask any of you to sacrifice three months of your life for me, I have a confession.	1
5424	Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics.	1
5425	Before we get started, I just want to thank you all for agreeing to relocate.	1
5426	Before we proceed any further, Doctor, I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure you intend to perform on the remains.	1
5427	behavior.	1
5428	Behind what?	1
5429	Being a live donor has risks.	1
5430	Being homeless isn't a vacation for me.	1
5431	Being normal is very important to Iris.	1
5432	Belief implies a level of giving a crap that I am never gonna achieve.	1
5433	Believe me, I'd rather be the guy with the clipboard.	1
5434	Ben, I-I don't think that's a good idea.	1
5435	Ben, you barely knew him.	1
5436	Ben, you keep your grades up, you can do anything in the world.	1
5437	Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.	1
5438	Benjamin! Benjamin, wait! Oh, my God.	1
5439	Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks.	1
5440	Better already.	1
5441	Better go do some of those clinic hours I recently doubled.	1
5442	Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.	1
5443	Better to have schtupped and lost then never to have schtupped at all.	1
5444	Based on his yellow fingers.	1
5445	Battery died.	1
5446	Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.	1
5447	Be at home.	1
5448	Beard's a nice touch.	1
5449	Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it.	1
5450	Because for some patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication.	1
5451	Because he doesn't treat them like scum.	1
5452	Because he said he apologized?	1
5453	Because he sees insecurity, and when House senses weakness, he pounces, and because his insecurity is the fact that other people can have faith and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.	1
5454	Because he was having headaches?	1
5455	Because his symptoms point towards an infection that spread to his brain.	1
5456	Because I can.	1
5457	Because I didn't.	1
5458	Because I didn'tive him time to do anything else.	1
5459	Because I found someone I love?	1
5460	Because I think I'm having a heart attack.	1
5461	Because I wanted to get out of here.	1
5462	Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.	1
5463	Because I'm just as bad as you.	1
5464	Because it was so shallow.	1
5465	Because it.	1
5466	because it's not that strong.	1
5467	Because it's so strong even plain contradictions.	1
5468	Because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.	1
5469	Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily ever after.	1
5470	Because no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance, you didn't buy it either.	1
5471	Because nothing will ever change how I feel about you guys.	1
5472	Because of his heart problems, but-- Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.	1
5473	Because people never lie about people they hate.	1
5474	Because taking him off the antiemetics gave us crucial diagnostic information.	1
5475	Because that's what every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of.	1
5476	Because the patient was unconscious.	1
5477	Because the patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.	1
5478	Because there isn't one.	1
5479	Because they don't cost anything.	1
5480	Because they don't know the real me.	1
5481	Because this is a bad idea, House.	1
5482	Because you had lousy parents.	1
5483	Because you realize they're not dull.	1
5484	Because you shouldn't be living on your own.	1
5485	Because you work for House.	1
5486	Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.	1
5487	Because you're an idiot.	1
5488	Because you're not dying.	1
5489	Because you're not gonna be able to breathe.	1
5490	Because you're paranoid about paranoia.	1
5491	Because, because I'll meet you at your place at 8:00.	1
5492	Because, because This is all you get.	1
5493	Because, eventually, he'll ask you to cross it.	1
5494	Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst.	1
5495	Aneurysm?	1
5496	Angina's back.	1
5497	Angiography showed a hemorrhagic site in the left lower lobe.	1
5498	Angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.	1
5499	angry and miserable?	1
5500	Angry at God or I just need a challenge?	1
5501	Animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming.	1
5502	animals.	1
5503	Anita, she's fun, smart.	1
5504	Anita.	1
5505	Annoyingly so.	1
5506	Another dozen getting teargas hosed off them.	1
5507	Another question is, could the paresthesia be caused by an STD?	1
5508	Answer the question before answering the door.	1
5509	Answer's no.	1
5510	Anti-anxiety medications would explain it.	1
5511	Antibiotics and IVIG.	1
5512	Antique locket-- it's unpolished gold.	1
5513	Any chance that could happen before 9:00?	1
5514	Any other symptoms?	1
5515	Any others?	1
5516	Any reason I shouldn't?	1
5517	Any recent health issues?	1
5518	Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye.	1
5519	Any type of birth control can fail.	1
5520	Anyone can screw up a life.	1
5521	Anyone notice.	1
5522	Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?	1
5523	Anything else?	1
5524	Anything?	1
5525	Anyway, he'd be getting better right now, not worse.	1
5526	Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.	1
5527	Apathetic hyperthyroidism.	1
5528	Aplastic anemia.	1
5529	Apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night.	1
5530	Apparently you were.	1
5531	Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr.	1
5532	Apparently, you were right about that one.	1
5533	Appears to be a gift.	1
5534	Apple juice.	1
5535	Appreciate your help.	1
5536	Approaching the clot.	1
5537	April Donaldson.	1
5538	Arceus?	1
5539	ARDS secondary to trauma is our leading hypothesis.	1
5540	Are there any side effects to the treatment?	1
5541	Are you all right?	1
5542	Are you asking me if I think my wife is trying to kill me?	1
5543	Are you calling his liver fat?	1
5544	Are you checking up on me or on House?	1
5545	Are you going to have me fired for bad manners?	1
5546	Are you gonna punish callousness?	1
5547	Are you gonna test my urine or what?	1
5548	Are you having trouble talking, like before?	1
5549	Are you in pain?	1
5550	Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?	1
5551	Are you now on the team?	1
5552	Already went away.	1
5553	Also explains the motorcycle crash.	1
5554	Also known as multiple personality disorder.	1
5555	Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best.	1
5556	Also, he started a betting pool on which kid is yours and which isn't.	1
5557	Also, I don't own a suit.	1
5558	Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.	1
5559	Although he can't take on any new clients right now, he's trying to get mean audition for one of those online soaps.	1
5560	Although I'm curious about a general answer too.	1
5561	Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a szechuan beef.	1
5562	Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.	1
5563	Although, to be fair, every man you've ever met has thought about having sex with you.	1
5564	Although, to be fair, I am large.	1
5565	Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy.	1
5566	Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.	1
5567	Alzheimer's is different.	1
5568	Bad news is.	1
5569	Bad parenting.	1
5570	Bad things sometimes happen.	1
5571	Bad.	1
5572	Bare necessities.	1
5573	Barraco azul?	1
5574	Barton.	1
5575	Add that to some peripheral red-green confusion, puts my money-- excuse me, your money-- soon to be my money on a tumor near his pituitary.	1
5576	Add the enlarged lymph node, macrocytosis.	1
5577	Andrews is the one that should leave.	1
5578	Andrews predicted the coma.	1
5579	Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA.	1
5580	! We have a little problem here! I need backup, I need backup! Alvarez! Mendelson! Sullivan! Mendelson! You're gonna pay for this.	1
5581	$100,000.	1
5582	$20, $1 million.	1
5583	$20,000.	1
5584	$20.	1
5585	$200,000.	1
5586	, and you're gonna go back to jail.	1
5587	We're in the middle of something.	1
5588	We're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit and check back in two minutes.	1
5589	We're leaving.	1
5590	We're missing symptoms.	1
5591	We're not done here.	1
5592	We're not done.	1
5593	We're not gonna tell him he was molested?	1
5594	We're not having an affair.	1
5595	We're not in touch.	1
5596	We're out of time when we're out of time.	1
5597	We're over five minutes.	1
5598	We're running out of time.	1
5599	We're separated.	1
5600	We're still waiting for that jell-o delivery.	1
5601	We're still working on the lungs.	1
5602	We're testing for iron overload.	1
5603	We're treating you for an overactive thyroid.	1
5604	We're trying to find money in our budget so we don't have to move our operations overseas.	1
5605	We're warming his blood outside of his body, then putting it back.	1
5606	Were you angry with Dr.	1
5607	Were you high on that trip?	1
5608	Were you taking Vicodin during this case?	1
5609	We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe.	1
5610	We've been separated for almost a year.	1
5611	We've brought people's kids back.	1
5612	We've got another five minutes.	1
5613	We've got brain activity.	1
5614	We've got nothing.	1
5615	We've got to get you back to the hospital right away.	1
5616	We've got two young kids.	1
5617	We've gotta stop seeing each other.	1
5618	We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.	1
5619	We've just been assuming.	1
5620	We've never had sex.	1
5621	We've run every test and ruled out all the options.	1
5622	We've talked about it a lot, and.	1
5623	We--went bankrupt five years ago.	1
5624	What about a stick of gum?	1
5625	What about a year ago?	1
5626	What about another clotting problem?	1
5627	What about both?	1
5628	What about Fahr's disease?	1
5629	What about gifts from South America?	1

5633	What about my team?	1
5634	What about over there?	1
5635	What about pheochromocytoma?	1

5643	What about transverse myelitis?	1
5644	What about Whipple's?	1
5645	What about you?	1
5646	What are they?	1
5647	What are we missing?	1
5648	What are you doing here?	1
5649	What are you doing to him?	1
5650	What are you doing with her?	1
5651	Well, I was the mom.	1
5652	Well, I'd take me if either of us could.	1
5653	Well, if he has normal pressure hydrocephalus, a tilt table test could put him in a coma.	1
5654	Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.	1
5655	Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding.	1
5656	Well, if I'm gonna die, I might as well do it with a clean soul.	1
5657	Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game.	1
5658	Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.	1
5659	Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help.	1
5660	Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to probable.	1
5661	Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.	1
5662	Well, if you change your mind, we'll be at Rudy's.	1
5663	Well, if you really want to thank me, my department's not really a department.	1
5664	Well, I'll tell you.	1
5665	Well, I'll try, but they spray so much pesticide I'm surprised we're alive.	1
5666	Well, I'm glad we could be so accommodating.	1
5667	Well, I'm gonna go through the laundry.	1
5668	Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night.	1
5669	Well, I'm walking back.	1
5670	Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch.	1
5671	Well, it's not like I can get up and run away.	1
5672	Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.	1
5673	Well, maybe Adams was right.	1
5674	Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.	1
5675	Well, no, because the interest isn't fake.	1
5676	Well, now that we've got that completely behind us.	1
5677	Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped.	1
5678	Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group?	1
5679	Well, that sucks.	1
5680	Well, that very evolved of you.	1
5681	Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.	1
5682	Well, the neighbors put in a pool, so he's been spending a lot of time over there.	1
5683	Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.	1
5684	Well, then what's this, then?	1
5685	Well, then, these giant balls of medicine are not gonna work anymore.	1
5686	Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.	1
5687	Well, think of this as today's free clinic.	1
5688	Well, we would.	1
5689	Well, what about the patient?	1
5690	Well, what if it was?	1
5691	Well, what's after respect?	1
5692	Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee.	1
5693	Well, when you put it that way.	1
5694	Well, why would anyone try to poison our guy?	1
5695	Well, you don't have a gun, but you do have my sunglasses, my tennis racket-- I can't imagine why-- Had to kill a mouse.	1
5696	Well, you know what?	1
5697	Well, you lied about the boyfriend.	1
5698	Well, you obviously found something.	1
5699	Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz.	1
5700	Ventricles are clear too.	1
5701	Ventricular fibrillation.	1
5702	Vertebral clear.	1
5703	Very helpful.	1
5704	Very interesting practice you must've run.	1
5705	Very.	1
5706	V-fib.	1
5707	Vicodin repeating on me.	1
5708	Vicodin-y.	1
5709	Violating the dead.	1
5710	Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict.	1
5711	viral infection weakening the wall muscles.	1
5712	Virus, virus, virus, virus.	1
5713	Vitamin K deficiency's a bust.	1
5714	Vomiting must have torn the lining.	1
5715	Vomiting stopped after the E.	1
5716	Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fever.	1
5717	Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! [Foy Vance's Be the Song] And when you run This is Mark Sanchez.	1
5718	Wait a minute, what's the big deal?	1
5719	Upper esophagus is clear.	1
5720	Upping the nitro should knock it back down.	1
5721	Use cross-matched platelets.	1
5722	Use the people already on the case.	1
5723	Used to have to pretend I was scared.	1
5724	Usually ?	1
5725	Usually, yeah.	1
5726	Usually?	1
5727	V.	1
5728	Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.	1
5729	Unlike you stealing my phone.	1
5730	Unlike you, I don't need drama.	1
5731	Unlimited Internet porn budget.	1
5732	Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.	1
5733	Until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was.	1
5734	Ulcer's bleeding.	1
5735	Ultrasound it is.	1
5736	Ultrasound.	1
5737	Um, I had an appointment in this part of town, and I absolutely didn't want to miss this meeting.	1
5738	Waiting for me at the table.	1
5739	Walking on her own.	1
5740	want to just have fun?	1
5741	want you to have them.	1
5742	Wanted to see him.	1
5743	Wanted to vent.	1
5744	Wanting to build a connection with your dad and pass on some of the joy that he gave you, that's not stupid at all.	1
5745	Wants treatment for diabetes.	1
5746	Was he sensitive to sunlight?	1
5747	Was I dehydrated or not?	1
5748	Was it really worth it?	1
5749	Was it Santa?	1
5750	Was nobody's fault.	1
5751	Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?	1
5752	Was that my wife?	1
5753	Was that table here?	1
5754	was the only neurologist I could reach.	1
5755	Was there any money in it?	1
5756	Wasn't in the medicine cabinet.	1
5757	Wasn't my best joke.	1
5758	Watch.	1
5759	Watching them, not making them.	1
5760	Water?	1
5761	Way.	1
5762	We actually started calling her Sophie.	1
5763	We all disagree all the time.	1
5764	We all have family dysfunction.	1
5765	We all knew a psychotic episode was one of the three possible outcomes.	1
5766	We all were.	1
5767	We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet.	1
5768	We also have a course in how to talk to someone in an interview.	1
5769	We also need to confirm and treat whatever's making him sick.	1
5770	We also probably ruined his life.	1
5771	We are veering wildly off track.	1
5772	We asked about toxins on the history.	1
5773	We belong to the same club.	1
5774	We booked the O.R. for an hour from now.	1
5775	We called 'em Drewisms.	1
5776	We can also provide clothes for the interview if you need them.	1
5777	We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound.	1
5778	We can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.	1
5779	We can do a lumbar puncture to confirm.	1
5780	We can do a partial liver transplant from a living donor.	1
5781	We can fix that.	1
5782	We can go through this together.	1
5783	We can start as soon as next week.	1
5784	We can't actually see them.	1
5785	We can't give you too much pain medication, or we'll make your condition worse.	1
5786	We can't smoke in here.	1
5787	We can't take it personally.	1
5788	We can't talk about this case anymore.	1
5789	We can't treat an underage patient without a guardian-- we need to call Social Services.	1
5790	We can't.	1
5791	We caught it early.	1
5792	We caused it by giving him steroids when he first came in.	1
5793	We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal.	1
5794	We did a major operation for no reason.	1
5795	we did what we could.	1
5796	We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the patient to take off.	1
5797	We didn't do a lot of talking.	1
5798	We didn't find any poisons.	1
5799	We didn't guess it because nobody gets it.	1
5800	We discussed it right here.	1
5801	We disproved his asexuality.	1
5802	We do not provide child care.	1
5803	We don't call, she doesn't bolt.	1
5804	We don't even have a tv in our office.	1
5805	We don't even know if they were sleeping together.	1
5806	We don't have a choice.	1
5807	We don't have any choice.	1
5808	We don't have the money to pay them.	1
5809	We don't know if you're better yet.	1
5810	We found more alcohol at your house.	1
5811	We get Kaw.	1
5812	We get to stay here with the people who've been so loyal to this company.	1
5813	We got a guy in an ambulance heading to Princeton General.	1
5814	We got about five minutes till pinto gets back.	1
5815	We got an order to reduce overcrowding.	1
5816	We got him breathing, but barely.	1
5817	We got the patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.	1
5818	We got to go for it.	1
5819	We gotta get her BP up before her organs start shutting down.	1
5820	We had a patient who was going to die without an AVM embolization.	1
5821	We had to stop the transfusion.	1
5822	We have a bet.	1
5823	We have a crisis.	1
5824	We have a problem.	1
5825	We have a reasoned disagreement.	1
5826	We have convened the disciplinary committee to decide the appropriate action that should be taken against Dr.	1
5827	We have time for one more test before we move him.	1
5828	We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.	1
5829	We have to wheel this out to the MRI.	1
5830	We haven't had sex.	1
5831	We he him on the donor list for a liver.	1
5832	We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian children.	1
5833	We just met.	1
5834	We just need a drop of blood.	1
5835	We just need to get a good look at the rash.	1
5836	We just need to know if-- - No, I already told you.	1
5837	We just need to know what happened.	1
5838	We killed part of the lung.	1
5839	We know there are some issues there, but your bone marrow could cure him.	1
5840	We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.	1
5841	We looked at his heart yesterday, didn't see any structural abnormalities.	1
5842	We married six months after I met him.	1
5843	We need a sniper rifle.	1
5844	We need racemic epinephrine.	1
5845	We need the nuclear option.	1
5846	We need theories.	1
5847	We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.	1
5848	We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg.	1
5849	We need to catch the end of our class.	1
5850	We need to get him to the point he was at last night.	1
5851	We need to get reckless and extreme.	1
5852	We need to hit it harder.	1
5853	We need to lavage before she drowns in her own blood.	1
5854	We need to not talk.	1
5855	We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.	1
5856	We need to take a biopsy.	1
5857	We need to talk about Saturday night.	1
5858	We need to track down all of them.	1
5859	We need to ultrasound.	1
5860	We need you to help us with something.	1
5861	We need you to show us remorse.	1
5862	We need you to sit, focus, and answer our questions.	1
5863	We needed a treatment that was a.	1
5864	We needed to see if it was still a symptom.	1
5865	We only help rich white guys?	1
5866	We only really started talking again because of the reenactments.	1
5867	We probably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this.	1
5868	We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine.	1
5869	We really gotta get you laid.	1
5870	We removed the artery.	1
5871	We ruled that out three days ago.	1
5872	We share a traveling X-ray machine two other clinics.	1
5873	We should add language loss and aggression.	1
5874	We should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.	1
5875	We should call the police.	1
5876	We should continue plasmapheresis.	1
5877	We should do a mental status examination and get a CT of his basel ganglia.	1
5878	We should find out if she's been vaccinated.	1
5879	We should know soon.	1
5880	We should make this a regular thing.	1
5881	We should probably leave the body in the bag.	1
5882	We shouldn't be here.	1
5883	We stayed at my place.	1
5884	We still can't rule it out.	1
5885	We still get to do crazy crap?	1
5886	We still got to get it out.	1
5887	We still have a long way to go.	1
5888	We still have no clue what's wrong.	1
5889	We swore that we would see the elephant together.	1
5890	We tested him for syphilis.	1
5891	We think that's why you passed out and couldn't move.	1
5892	We think we've dealt wit all the liability issues.	1
5893	We think you were having sex, but memory loss could also be a symptom.	1
5894	We thought it was the salt pork.	1
5895	We thought the case was over.	1
5896	We took a cooking class.	1
5897	We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding.	1
5898	We tried that already.	1
5899	We try to get you up to 50 words per minute.	1
5900	We used to walk and get some every morning at that bakery.	1
5901	We wait 30 minutes, she'll definitely have brain damage.	1
5902	We watched a lot of TV.	1
5903	We watched a lotta TV.	1
5904	We watched the Devils demolish the Rangers.	1
5905	We went a clinic in Trenton.	1
5906	We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late.	1
5907	We were just looking for you.	1
5908	We were talking about how you got the abrasions on your knees.	1
5909	We were together the whole time.	1
5910	We won't have the results until the morning.	1
5911	We work for it.	1
5912	We would have had to biopsy his lymph nodes anyway to check for cancer.	1
5913	We would have seen evidence of brugada in the E.K.G.	1
5914	Weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated BP, causes it to expand and contract.	1
5915	Wear them while you masturbate?	1
5916	Weathers, I am sure you're right, but we need to be thorough.	1
5917	Weaving through the cracks we are simply human Whoops.	1
5918	We'd like to perform an exercise test, re-create the stress that may have caused his symptoms.	1
5919	We'd risk aspiration.	1
5920	Wednesday, 2:43 p.m. , a black Pawn will believe he's the black King and attempt to capture the.	1
5921	Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes.	1
5922	We'll check catecholamines for pheo and run an expanded opioid panel.	1
5923	We'll continue with the medicine.	1
5924	What did the endoscopy show?	1
5925	What did you think was gonna happen?	1
5926	What did your parents do to you?	1
5927	What did your screwed-up parents do to screw up your view of parenting?	1
5928	What do I need to do for you?	1
5929	what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing problems?	1
5930	What do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?	1
5931	What do you mean?	1
5932	What do you think?	1
5933	What do you want us to do?	1
5934	What do you want?	1
5935	What do you-- what do you want?	1
5936	What does it matter if she says she's asexual?	1
5937	What does it mean?	1
5938	What does that mean?	1
5939	What does this mean?	1
5940	What does.	1
5941	What else don't I know?	1
5942	What else is she gonna think?	1
5943	What else would explain our symptoms and make our patient go into a coma during that test?	1
5944	What else?	1
5945	What exactly are they building back there?	1
5946	What exactly are you scared of?	1
5947	What exactly were you doing when you had your reaction?	1
5948	Wait for it.	1
5949	Wait right here.	1
5950	Wait until they take him back to his room--draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.	1
5951	Wait, Dr.	1
5952	Wait, he was drunk?	1
5953	Wait, I thought-- I thought you said it was stable.	1
5954	Wait, is this like a bucket list thing?	1
5955	Wait, we're gonna be here a while.	1

5977	We'll reschedule.	1
5978	We'll run a pregnancy test.	1

5980	We'll start the steroids and see if it clears up.	1
5981	We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.	1
5982	We'll take care of Nick.	1
5983	Well, don't look at me.	1
5984	Well, Dr.	1
5985	Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911, unless they said we were armed, it's low priority.	1
5986	Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their elephant.	1
5987	Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.	1
5988	Well, he was all, you know, I could take Stomper.	1
5989	Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?	1
5990	Well, how about.	1
5991	Well, how do you do that?	1
5992	Well, I can't just leave this up to her.	1
5993	Well, I guess I don't have a son anymore.	1
5994	Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work.	1
5995	Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.	1
5996	Well, I know that Jesus walked on water but.	1
5997	We're almost there.	1
5998	We're asexual.	1
5999	We're close to the point of no return.	1
6000	We're consulting with Neurology.	1
6001	We're discharging him.	1
6002	We're doctors.	1
6003	We're doing the tilt table.	1
6004	We're doing them a favor.	1
6005	were free.	1
6006	We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?	1
6007	We're going to the cath lab?	1
6008	We're going to the Doctor's office.	1
6009	We're going to the hospital for tests.	1
6010	We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.	1
6011	We're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this.	1
6012	We're gonna try again.	1
6013	We're in the car, honey.	1
6014	What happens when the stunt doesn't work?	1
6015	What I can't work with is someone who's here so she doesn't have to feel bad.	1
6016	What if he has a heightened immune system?	1
6017	What if I die, and one day she finds out I cheated on her?	1
6018	What if I just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?	1
6019	What if it wasn't an accident?	1
6020	What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?	1
6021	What if it's not an allergic reaction?	1

6025	What if the chicken was the egg?	1
6026	What if the lung involvement came first?	1
6027	What if the scrapings from the bridge chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.	1

6034	What kind?	1
6035	What looks like kidney disease, but isn't?	1
6036	What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you.	1
6037	What makes you-- Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes since this morning.	1
6038	What round of chelation is this?	1
6039	What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.	1
6040	What test?	1
6041	What text?	1
6042	What the hell are you doing here?	1
6043	What the hell are you doing?	1
6044	What the hell does that mean?	1
6045	What the hell is happening to me?	1
6046	What took you so long?	1
6047	What was his heart rate?	1
6048	What was in the box?	1
6049	What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis.	1

6057	Vasculitis fits.	1
6058	Vasculitis.	1
6059	What five grand?	1
6060	What fun would that be?	1
6061	What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?	1

6065	What would Cuddy have done?	1
6066	What would House want with a skin resurfacing laser?	1
6067	What would you think if you found out years later your beloved dead wife cheated on you?	1
6068	What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.	1
6069	What you're headed towards now, 14 hours a day in silent prayer, never having a family, never touching another human being.	1
6070	What, getting knifed doesn't buy me an extension?	1
6071	What, so I can get busted by Social Services?	1
6072	What, that's it?	1
6073	What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?	1
6074	What's House up to?	1
6075	What's left.	1
6076	What's somewhere he could see the kids arrive?	1
6077	What's that I smell, friiend?	1

6079	What's the difference?	1
6080	What's the first step?	1
6081	What's the hiring policy over there?	1
6082	What'd I miss?	1
6083	What'd you give him?	1
6084	What'd you think?	1
6085	Whatever age, living on the street makes her vulnerable to malnutrition, drug use, H.I.V. , all things which could explain her symptoms.	1
6086	Whatever test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.	1
6087	Whatever the reason, it boils down to the fact that you may never walk again because House created an atmosphere that promotes recklessness.	1
6088	Whatever's gonna get him better.	1
6089	What's going on?	1
6090	What's happening to me?	1
6091	Why lie about it?	1
6092	Why should you have to spend the night?	1
6093	Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it?	1
6094	Why the hell not?	1
6095	Why was it not already in the patient history?	1
6096	Why would he do that?	1
6097	Why would I agree?	1
6098	Why would I be trying to make him look bad?	1
6099	Why would I do this now?	1
6100	Why would I need a gun?	1
6101	Why would I?	1
6102	Why would she think you're a prostitute?	1
6103	Why would they thank him?	1
6104	Why would you lie about that?	1
6105	Why would you say any of that?	1
6106	Why would you think you needed so many guns?	1
6107	Why would you want to do that?	1
6108	Why, is that bad?	1
6109	Why.	1
6110	Why are you looking at her?	1
6111	Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?	1
6112	Why are you still here?	1
6113	Why are you up here?	1
6114	Why aren't you more alarmed?	1
6115	Why did you ignore that risk?	1
6116	Why didn't you ever tell me?	1
6117	Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?	1
6118	Why didn't you tell me that before?	1
6119	Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and never write with?	1

6124	Why does he have a file?	1
6125	Why doesn't Chase have to be here?	1
6126	Why don't you check his vaccination record before you make another stupid.	1
6127	Why don't you go home and get some sleep?	1
6128	Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry-- I didn't do anything wrong.	1
6129	Why don't you show Joseph where the visitor's lounge is?	1
6130	Why don't you stay here toght?	1
6131	Why don't you take preventative?	1
6132	Why exactly is that good for you?	1
6133	Why is he so obsessed with my kids being my kids?	1
6134	Why is it my choice?	1
6135	Why is it still rising?	1
6136	What's wrong with my stomach?	1
6137	what's wrong?	1
6138	What's your dentist's name?	1

6147	When I ate strawberries.	1
6148	When I left the room, he was telling her about the strippers from his bachelor party.	1
6149	When I paid him a visit, he took off.	1
6150	When I saw her waiting.	1
6151	When I started giving away the money, I-- I hoped she'd want to do it with me.	1
6152	When I was your age, I ran away.	1
6153	When my mother drank, she couldn't handle me, so she locked me in my father's study.	1
6154	When she opened the Magic 8 Ball, that triggered a switch to a personality with a strawberry allergy.	1
6155	When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just.	1
6156	When they die or she dies.	1
6157	When Vanessa was ready to quit chemo, Bobby's the one who got her to do one more round.	1
6158	When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?	1
6159	When you saw the boy.	1
6160	When you say your boyfriend hit you, it means you actually hit yourself.	1
6161	when you treat, and he gets better, and doesn't give Bob Cratchit Christmas day off, you owe me a coffee.	1
6162	When your dad showed up unexpectedly, House have a hand in that?	1

6176	Where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose.	1
6177	Where was practice?	1

6191	Which actually doesn't prove anything.	1
6192	Which also happens to be what the mom wants to believe.	1
6193	Which apparently really bugs you.	1
6194	Which artery?	1
6195	Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.	1
6196	Which brings me to my most relevant question.	1
6197	Which brings us back to, why do you care?	1
6198	Which could also be caused by choriocarcinoma, which affects the placenta, mimics pregnancy, and causes elevated BP and vaginal bleeding.	1
6199	Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.	1
6200	Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony.	1
6201	Which he started.	1
6202	Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.	1
6203	Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them.	1
6204	Which idiot did the pregnancy test?	1
6205	Which is a good thing, because neither GAD nor systemic infection would cause anaphylaxis or tracheal edema.	1
6206	Which is awesome.	1
6207	Which is basically why we missed it.	1
6208	Which is good news for you.	1

6211	Which is step 17.	1
6212	Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.	1
6213	Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam.	1
6214	Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.	1
6215	Which is why you should accept his apology and come back on the team.	1
6216	Which is why you're not gonna live there either.	1
6217	Which it's not.	1
6218	Which means he goes home.	1
6219	Which means he wasn't really hurt.	1
6220	Which means he's both irascible and stupid.	1
6221	Which means I wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week by child locking all my cabinets, padding table corners, and getting rid of every single magazine.	1
6222	Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.	1
6223	Which means it's too late for me to back down.	1
6224	Which means not family.	1
6225	Which means that Foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion.	1
6226	Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.	1
6227	Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun.	1
6228	Which means you proved nothing.	1
6229	Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or because there is no new girl.	1
6230	Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right.	1
6231	Which means you're both idiots.	1
6232	Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.	1
6233	Which one are you?	1
6234	Which one of you is the cheap bastard?	1
6235	Which proves she's an idiot.	1
6236	Which provides a nice contrast.	1
6237	which she'll prove when her parents show up and you start protecting her from them.	1
6238	Which there isn't.	1
6239	Which we won't know, because the E.R. put him on antiemetics.	1
6240	Which will be bad news for both of you.	1
6241	Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.	1
6242	Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.	1
6243	Which would mean.	1
6244	which you might have, by the way.	1
6245	Which you're gonna use to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.	1
6246	Which, in turn, in turn, makes you so fired.	1
6247	Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker.	1
6248	While I was on the operating table, it didn't feel like a dream.	1
6249	While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.	1

6266	Who used to babysit Drew?	1
6267	Who?	1
6268	Who's better qualified to be the daddy?	1
6269	Who's Taub?	1
6270	Wh--uhh.	1
6271	Wh-what if I don't want the treatment?	1
6272	Wh-what if I had a history with, uh.	1
6273	Why a man in your position, with your abilities, is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.	1
6274	Why are we stealing cable from here?	1
6275	Why are you doing time?	1
6276	That's right, all those babies with aids, they're just using us.	1
6277	That's the correct answer, isn't it?	1
6278	That's the reason?	1
6279	That's what he implied.	1
6280	That's what I always said to you, Callie, but I had a problem-- I'm nothing like you! Tell them to do the surgery.	1
6281	That's what I just said.	1
6282	That's what I object to.	1
6283	That's what I said.	1
6284	That's what those guns are.	1
6285	That's what those vitamin pills were.	1
6286	That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.	1
6287	That's when you started to excel.	1
6288	That's why all parents screw up all children.	1
6289	That's why Drew made up his own words.	1
6290	That's why he'd lie to the guards.	1
6291	That's why House used the hurt boyfriend story.	1
6292	That's why I did this.	1
6293	That's why I told you.	1
6294	That's why I would like her sister to live near my home.	1
6295	That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	1
6296	That's why we're successful.	1
6297	That's why we're taking the case?	1
6298	That's why you cried out when House shot at Taub.	1
6299	That's why you left him?	1
6300	That's why you wanted companionship.	1
6301	That's why you were late.	1
6302	That's why you're relieved.	1
6303	That's your follow-up?	1
6304	That's.	1

6319	The best dads wait two or more.	1
6320	The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation.	1
6321	The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing! I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.	1
6322	The blast will fry what's left of his liver.	1
6323	The bleeder's got to be in here.	1
6324	The bleeding is in her gut.	1
6325	The bleeding stopped on its own.	1

6331	The buildup of toxins is causing everything.	1
6332	The bulge in his neck.	1
6333	The bulge wasn't caused by pus or blood.	1
6334	The car accident?	1
6335	The chair squeaked.	1
6336	The change actually makes things simpler.	1
6337	The classes make him sympathetic.	1
6338	The closest I got was Waimea Bay.	1
6339	The condition being that you're employed by me at PPTH.	1
6340	The Confederacy gave men $21 every six months-- - You poisoned us both.	1
6341	The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.	1
6342	The confederates be giving themselves spankin' new tats.	1
6343	The crew's just starting.	1
6344	The cure will kill him.	1
6345	The daughter said that her mother died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	1
6346	The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.	1
6347	The details are just gravy.	1
6348	The dining room's on the other side of that wall.	1
6349	The donor had hemosiderosis.	1
6350	The donor spends a week in the hospita and up to three months convalescing at home.	1
6351	The E.E.G. didn't show any abnormal brain activity.	1
6352	The E.R. Docs interviewed his wife.	1
6353	The echo will show us any growths on his heart valve.	1
6354	The evidence pointed to psychosis.	1
6355	The explosion does.	1
6356	The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open.	1
6357	The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up.	1
6358	The fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her.	1
6359	The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting.	1
6360	The fact that she didn't burst into tears tells me that you never thought he was your dad.	1
6361	The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.	1
6362	The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.	1
6363	The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot.	1
6364	The facts of this case, on the other hand-- the facts are in the file.	1
6365	The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.	1
6366	The first one was regarding Chase.	1
6367	The first pair were $120.	1
6368	The first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment.	1
6369	the flag football ga.	1
6370	The food that you're eating to stop making you sick is making you sick.	1
6371	The fourth thing you said was, where's my old environment?	1
6372	The game started at 7:00.	1
6373	The girl I was seeing wasn't.	1
6374	The good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.	1
6375	The good news is, made me realize that you were right.	1
6376	The gun slipped and-- I only had blanks in it, but.	1
6377	The guy has earned the right to go to one boxing match.	1
6378	The guy was going downhill fast.	1
6379	The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.	1
6380	The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like not shtupping mommy after the divorce?	1
6381	The guy's potassium is off.	1
6382	The health fair is one of my responsibilities.	1
6383	The Heparin could cause the patient to bleed into his lungs even faster.	1
6384	The Heparin decision didn't have anything to do with the outcome.	1
6385	The hospital brought in a consultant to work on the lungs.	1
6386	The hypothermia could've caused cell necrosis.	1
6387	The illness is alcohol-related.	1
6388	The immunosuppressants we gave him sent it into overdrive.	1
6389	The jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.	1
6390	The job went away, but not the profession.	1
6391	The joke gift, not the cocaine.	1
6392	The joy that he gave me.	1
6393	The kid's our patient.	1
6394	The laundry room.	1
6395	The legendary night on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.	1
6396	The lies she must be telling him.	1
6397	The liver failure could be from intraoperative hypotension.	1
6398	The lung donor didn't have cancer.	1
6399	The lungs are a smoker.	1
6400	The lungs are dry.	1
6401	The lungs will never be viable for transplant.	1
6402	The Magic 8 Ball.	1
6403	The man she married no longer exists.	1
6404	The math is pretty basic.	1
6405	The mayor checked.	1
6406	The medical term is cankles.	1
6407	The Mexican pipeline.	1
6408	the money.	1
6409	The mood swings come on quickly, but, um.	1
6410	the motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.	1
6411	The name she registered under seems to be fake, but the address is a foreclosed house.	1
6412	The nasty kind.	1
6413	The neuro symptoms and the rash were both signs of an underlying disease.	1
6414	The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks.	1
6415	The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.	1
6416	The nurses talk.	1
6417	The ol' swap trick?	1
6418	The one asking me to bring you some dinner.	1
6419	The one who died.	1
6420	The only evidence you have is proof of something else.	1
6421	The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying.	1
6422	The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.	1
6423	The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.	1
6424	The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.	1
6425	The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one.	1
6426	The original script was-- - Shh, shh, shh.	1
6427	The other one's Sophia.	1
6428	The part where he said any parent who uses day care should ship their child across the country?	1
6429	The patient asked me what I thought.	1
6430	The Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather.	1
6431	The place'll be a madhouse, especially since it's two miles from the Rubio fight at the exact same time.	1
6432	The plasmapheresis hasn't had time to work, but TTP is our most likely-- Okay, I'm just-- I have to go look for him.	1
6433	The point is, I gave it to you, so we're even.	1
6434	The police have been notified.	1
6435	The pregnancy?	1
6436	The problem isn't his marrow.	1
6437	The problem was the patient's brain.	1
6438	The prodigal son has returned.	1
6439	The question is, what explains the liver failure?	1
6440	The rash?	1
6441	The repartee.	1
6442	The rest of you.	1
6443	The risk is 1 in 4,000 I could die during surgery, which means, if I don't donate, I'm valuing my life at 4,000 times someone else's.	1
6444	The rivets go pop, I slide in the heating pad.	1
6445	The secretary said you were on leave.	1
6446	The self-defense classes, you think they're making any kind of difference?	1
6447	The sound I make is, moooo! The sound I make is, quack quack quack quack quack.	1
6448	The sound is quack.	1
6449	The spa.	1
6450	The stink bomb was Chase's.	1
6451	The stress! And I get the runs almost every day.	1
6452	The student aide was just trying to make a viral video, not hurt anyone.	1
6453	The symptoms can take up to three days to manifest.	1
6454	The symptoms fit, and Andrews is a hack.	1
6455	The team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation.	1
6456	The technical term is slow.	1
6457	The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass.	1
6458	The test is designed to determine if you're-- No, I mean your running a test and discharging me.	1
6459	The test is negative.	1
6460	The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check foany abnormalities.	1
6461	The thing is, House.	1
6462	The tox screen was clean.	1
6463	The transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.	1
6464	The tumor interferes with certain natural systems.	1
6465	The usual safe ideas were not gonna work.	1
6466	The water.	1
6467	The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the Universe, it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect.	1
6468	The way her eyes looked when she smiled.	1
6469	The whole town knows that you're in the hospital.	1
6470	The wife didn't know about the explosion.	1
6471	The wife said she was sure to clear the house for her husband's safety.	1
6472	The wife shut down a floral company to stay home and feed him every meal he's had in the last four years.	1
6473	The windows were closed.	1
6474	The woman I love.	1
6475	The word fever.	1
6476	The word transient is right there in the name.	1
6477	The world does that sometimes.	1
6478	The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart.	1
6479	The X-ray didn't show any tumors.	1
6480	the.	1
6481	Their husbands.	1
6482	Their son just died.	1
6483	Then animal cases and ghost cases.	1
6484	Then animal ghost cases.	1
6485	Then don't believe her, and start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	1
6486	Then find someone who does.	1
6487	Then go back to neurology.	1
6488	Then he'll doze off, and then in a couple hours, he'll thank us again.	1
6489	Then he's allergic to something not on the tests.	1
6490	Then he's not allergic to it.	1
6491	Then I decided I should test his wallet.	1
6492	Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks.	1
6493	Then I have to tell them first.	1
6494	Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever.	1
6495	Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?	1
6496	Then it's a good thing he has A.	1
6497	Then leave it up to me, and just leave.	1
6498	Then my dad got into narcotics, at first just selling but then using too, or he never would have gotten into the slave trade.	1
6499	Then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.	1
6500	Then there's nothing we can do.	1
6501	Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.	1
6502	Then we can shock it back into rhythm.	1
6503	Then we have to assume liver failure is just another symptom of whatever she's got.	1
6504	Then we'll know what set it off.	1
6505	Then we're going home.	1
6506	Then we've got to biopsy.	1
6507	Then what is it?	1
6508	Then why are you doing this?	1
6509	Then why isn't he saturated?	1
6510	Then why'd you lie about it?	1
6511	Then why're you telling me?	1
6512	Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.	1
6513	Then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.	1
6514	Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.	1
6515	there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round You're fired.	1
6516	There are 70,000 people in this country on the active waiting list for a kidney, and less than 10,000 dead people a year to give them one.	1
6517	There are a lot of good administrators out there, not many good doctors.	1
6518	There are hundreds of people who would do that for you.	1
6519	There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.	1
6520	There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.	1
6521	There are other options besides living on the streets.	1
6522	There are other ways to save the company.	1
6523	There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?	1
6524	There are those eyes again.	1
6525	There are two types of people.	1
6526	There are very serious risks, but if we don't figure out what he has, we can't treat him at all.	1
6527	There he is.	1
6528	There is a free clinic in Trenton.	1
6529	There is a symptom.	1
6530	There is a way that you can get your money back.	1
6531	There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.	1
6532	There is something in this world you are undeniably great at.	1
6533	There is.	1
6534	There it is.	1
6535	There really was nothing for him to do.	1
6536	That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.	1
6537	that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our patient.	1
6538	That blood looks pretty dry.	1
6539	That bloodwork is week's old.	1
6540	That can't be good.	1
6541	That comes with a rash.	1
6542	That could be fixable.	1
6543	That could have happened to anyone.	1
6544	That counts for a lot.	1
6545	That didn't come up last night?	1
6546	That doesn't make me a bad person.	1
6547	That doesn't mean I have a problem.	1
6548	That doesn't mean you couldn't get angry.	1
6549	That explains everything but the lymph nodes.	1
6550	That falls under natural causes.	1
6551	That fire, the bruise on your face.	1
6552	That God's love is speaking to you directly.	1
6553	That I can get out of here soon.	1
6554	That is a sign of concern.	1
6555	That is nothing to be ashamed of.	1
6556	That is ridiculous.	1
6557	That is six miles out of my way.	1
6558	That is so fifth grade.	1
6559	That is, if I'm right.	1
6560	That just leaves.	1
6561	That last insult was your cue to leave.	1
6562	That last one may not be universal.	1
6563	That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives.	1
6564	That makes sense.	1
6565	That mass wasn't a tumor.	1
6566	That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking.	1
6567	That means low self-esteem.	1
6568	That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland.	1
6569	That new transmission I put in your truck.	1
6570	That normally happens every 30 days.	1
6571	That only takes a couple of hours.	1
6572	That people don't change.	1
6573	That seems like an overreaction.	1
6574	That should be enough for all of us.	1
6575	That soccer trophy you were telling me about.	1
6576	That sounds hopeful.	1
6577	That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching Martin Brodeur shut out the Rangers.	1
6578	That the heart does go on My patient is running out of time.	1
6579	That unexpected things happen.	1
6580	That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is not surprisingly wrong.	1
6581	That was 12 years ago.	1
6582	That was fun.	1
6583	That was great.	1
6584	That was it.	1
6585	That was made clear.	1
6586	That was nothing.	1
6587	That was pure luck too.	1
6588	That was repartee.	1
6589	That was so I could ask about the second possibility.	1
6590	That was the whole point.	1
6591	That was to show Adams that mommie dearest hadn't changed.	1
6592	That wasn't me.	1
6593	That went over well.	1
6594	That woman sees everything to do with her daughter through.	1
6595	That would mean that every symptom after his T.I.A. was a coincidence.	1
6596	That wouldn't be related.	1
6597	That'd mean the damage was permanent.	1
6598	That'll confirm.	1
6599	That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.	1
6600	That'll teach me to overbill.	1
6601	That's $4,500.	1
6602	That's 40.	1
6603	That's a good idea.	1
6604	That's a good start.	1
6605	That's a mixed signal.	1
6606	That's a pretty nice trophy, there, Andres.	1
6607	That's a side effect of not dying.	1
6608	That's a very moving story.	1
6609	That's already ruled out.	1
6610	That's also true.	1
6611	That's an insult to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.	1
6612	That's an oxymoron.	1
6613	That's because he is actually trying to get you fired.	1
6614	That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.	1
6615	That's better.	1
6616	That's 'cause he's retooled the ol' todger.	1
6617	That's completely normal.	1
6618	That's cool.	1
6619	That's desperate.	1
6620	That's everything bad that's happened.	1
6621	That's good news.	1
6622	That's good.	1
6623	That's House.	1
6624	That's how daddy likes to spend his time too.	1
6625	That's idiotic.	1
6626	That's impossible.	1
6627	That's it.	1
6628	That's just hurtful.	1
6629	That's my dark secret.	1
6630	That's my lotion.	1
6631	That's my old boss.	1
6632	That's my whiteboard.	1
6633	That's naive and sick.	1
6634	That's Nicole.	1
6635	That's normal.	1
6636	That's not a favor.	1
6637	That's not a gun.	1
6638	That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.	1
6639	That's not a very shameful walk of shame.	1
6640	That's not an answer.	1
6641	That's not from a fungal infection.	1
6642	That's not gonna help.	1
6643	That's not it.	1
6644	That's not lupus.	1
6645	That's not medicine.	1
6646	That's not supposed to happen, right?	1
6647	That's not the same.	1
6648	That's not what I said.	1
6649	That's not what you wanted to tell her.	1
6650	That's okay.	1
6651	That's real mature, House.	1
6652	That's really dark.	1
6653	Thrombus?	1
6654	Thyrotoxicosis?	1
6655	TIA.	1
6656	Tick borne disease season.	1
6657	Time to grow up and come clean.	1
6658	Tired of surfing.	1
6659	To a guy who loves penis enough for the both of them.	1
6660	To avoid having this conversation.	1
6661	To do that, I need to know what he's doing and planning.	1
6662	To fill that hole.	1
6663	to give it to the same lady?	1
6664	To give you the excitement you need so you don't go looking for it.	1
6665	To have fun.	1
6666	To help people the way I always wanted.	1
6667	To keep me from lying to patients?	1
6668	To live, oh and I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds gets so hard in times like now to hold on but guns they wait to be stuck by Thirteen.	1
6669	To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?	1
6670	To put it another way, a patriot.	1
6671	To tell him the truth.	1
6672	To the proof store.	1
6673	To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression.	1
6674	To you.	1
6675	Today.	1
6676	Together with the lung, it added up to Wegener's.	1
6677	Told me to call him if you did.	1
6678	Tommy, what is it?	1
6679	Tommy's the most popular guy in his office.	1
6680	Tomorrow morning, I am supposed to sign a piece of paper that will.	1
6681	Tonight?	1
6682	Too late for your eyesight.	1
6683	Took a job-- Don't need the details.	1
6684	Took a team that was 0-6 all the way to the state finals at Long Branch.	1
6685	Took real good care of himself.	1
6686	Torture, rape.	1
6687	Totally offsets the stench of suffereing and death.	1
6688	Totally.	1
6689	Touche.	1
6690	Tox screen is clear.	1
6691	Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine.	1
6692	Tox screen was clean.	1
6693	Toxins are the most.	1
6694	Toxins.	1
6695	Tracin' faces I'm craving nachos.	1
6696	Traffic, for sure.	1
6697	Transesophageal echo to confirm.	1
6698	Transfusing his platelets will keep him healthy while we wait.	1
6699	Transplant team ran an A.	1
6700	Transverse myelitis.	1
6701	Treat for GAD.	1
6702	Treat her for alcoholism.	1
6703	Treat the patient with activated protein c.	1
6704	Treat with Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid.	1
6705	Trousseau's syndrome could send clots, cause the ischemic foot.	1
6706	True.	1
6707	Trust me on this one.	1
6708	Trust me.	1
6709	Truth.	1
6710	Try not to kill anyone else until I get back.	1
6711	Try to find the patient some blood that's closer to his own.	1
6712	Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.	1
6713	Tsk.	1
6714	TTP fits, though.	1
6715	TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out.	1
6716	Tularemia doesn't always show up in blood work either.	1
6717	Turn that off.	1
6718	Turn to an inch to the left.	1
6719	Turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.	1
6720	Turns out I like boring.	1
6721	Turns out they monitor these monitors.	1
6722	Turns out we caused that.	1
6723	Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy.	1
6724	Two ccs Lidocaine.	1
6725	Two days, one surgery.	1
6726	Two explosions.	1
6727	Two hours ago, I found this in your closet in a box with your name on it.	1
6728	Two hours ago.	1
6729	Two lives are in the balance here.	1
6730	Two of you go find her and find out what.	1
6731	Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.	1
6732	two options.	1
6733	Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.	1
6734	Two prodigal sons.	1
6735	Two rounds of 360 without establishing a rhythm.	1
6736	two sentences in, and you're already making promises.	1
6737	Two to the head.	1
6738	Ugh! We hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.	1
6739	Uh, Bill.	1
6740	Uh, can we help you?	1
6741	Uh, excuse me, miss, what is your name?	1
6742	Uh, General.	1
6743	Uh, I'll-- I'll be outside.	1
6744	Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you.	1
6745	Uh, it's nothing personal.	1
6746	Uh, it's nothing.	1
6747	Uh, like five months ago.	1
6748	Uh, no, it's, um.	1
6749	Uh, no, thanks.	1
6750	Uh, uh.	1
6751	Uh, you use it to get food from inside.	1
6752	Uh, you.	1
6753	Uh, y-yes, sir.	1
6754	Unless he was still being poisoned.	1
6755	Unless I need to say, mother, may I?	1
6756	Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.	1
6757	Unless you want your own hearing.	1
6758	Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician with political contacts, I'm busy.	1
6759	Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot.	1
6760	Unless you're wrong.	1
6761	Unbelievable.	1
6762	Understand your confusion.	1
6763	Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage-- dehydration.	1
6764	Unfortunately, no.	1
6765	Unfortunately, that's not why we're here.	1
6766	Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.	1
6767	Unfortunately, yeah.	1
6768	Unfortunately, yes.	1
6769	The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher.	1
6770	The patient was faking?	1
6771	The patient was punched in the groin.	1
6772	The patient will punch his wife.	1
6773	There was a problem, but.	1
6774	There was no repartee.	1
6775	There was nothing owed.	1
6776	There wasn't any abnormal electrical activity in his E.	1
6777	There wasn't any money missing from the scholarship fund.	1
6778	There will be some discomfort.	1
6779	Thanks a lot.	1
6780	Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.	1
6781	Thanks again.	1
6782	Thanks for all my help.	1
6783	Thanks for all your help.	1
6784	Thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.	1
6785	Thanks, but I got a lot of work I need to get done.	1
6786	Thanks, House.	1
6787	Take off my monitor.	1
6788	Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.	1
6789	Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.	1
6790	Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.	1
6791	Take the damn $2.	1
6792	Take this.	1
6793	T.I.A., thickened pericardium, and now he's bleeding from his nose and mouth.	1
6794	Tabes dorsalis.	1
6795	Take her off the Ceftriaxone.	1
6796	Take him off antiemetics, do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds.	1
6797	Take him off.	1
6798	Take him out of there.	1
6799	Straight as after that.	1
6800	Stress test too.	1
6801	Stress wouldn't be relevant, but anything that increases his adrenalin could have made it worse.	1
6802	Strong, emotional reaction.	1
6803	Stuff like what employers are looking for, how to turn negatives into positives.	1
6804	Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.	1
6805	Supposed to talk to his P.O. about getting his ankle monitor off early.	1
6806	Sure you are, buddy.	1
6807	Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	1
6808	Sure, I'll feel guilty, start doubting.	1
6809	There's a canal near my mother's house.	1
6810	There's a difference between an isolated riot and the fall of civilization.	1
6811	There's a hospital two miles from here.	1
6812	There's a little mass here, and I'd like to get it checked out.	1
6813	There's a magnet on the fridge they use to open child-proofed cabinets.	1
6814	There's a mass in the arm.	1
6815	There's a neurological issue.	1
6816	There's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people.	1
6817	There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.	1
6818	There's always chemo.	1
6819	There's an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery of his brain.	1
6820	There's blood in his urine bag.	1
6821	There's definitely no poisons I could have accidentally been exposed to at home.	1
6822	There's definitely something wrong with him.	1
6823	There's gotta be a deeper reason.	1
6824	There's just wet gum under here.	1
6825	there's more.	1
6826	There's no actual risk.	1
6827	There's no breath sounds.	1
6828	There's no calcification.	1
6829	There's no joint pain.	1
6830	There's no living relatives that I know of.	1
6831	There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.	1
6832	There's no need to put him under.	1
6833	There's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest X-ray.	1
6834	there's no sign of tropheryma DNA.	1
6835	There's no treatment for it.	1
6836	There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip.	1
6837	There's no way that I'm letting.	1
6838	There's no way that Robin gave me an STD.	1
6839	There's nothing profound here.	1
6840	There's nothing to talk about.	1
6841	There's only one way to find out.	1
6842	There's plenty of kids who hate their parents.	1
6843	There's plenty of time for that after the operation.	1
6844	There's some sweats in the closet in the back.	1
6845	There's someone I would like to call.	1
6846	There's subtle eyebrow loss.	1
6847	There's the two of you kissing over dinner.	1
6848	These abrasions on his knees.	1
6849	These are ringside seats.	1
6850	These are supposed to be in the computer files.	1
6851	These are your training wheels.	1
6852	These guys have got that covered.	1
6853	These personalities that I'm supposed to have.	1
6854	These rug burns are from last night.	1
6855	These.	1
6856	they actually have two completely different derivations.	1
6857	They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.	1
6858	They are kind of boring.	1
6859	They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.	1
6860	They blew it, didn't they?	1
6861	They can be pretty hard to detect in people under 50.	1
6862	They could've moved back.	1
6863	They decided that your being stabbed.	1
6864	They did a bunch of vaccinations, including pneumococcus.	1
6865	They did a lateral view as well.	1
6866	They don't even really know me.	1
6867	They exist, right?	1
6868	They expect a full recovery.	1
6869	They found it.	1
6870	They found the tumor.	1
6871	They get to just hang out and do nothing?	1
6872	They give out four a day, Max.	1
6873	They had banana muffins downstairs.	1
6874	They had on on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off.	1
6875	They had to be incredibly high.	1
6876	They hurt all your bits.	1
6877	They just don't like you.	1
6878	They just don't usually broadcast all of them at the same time.	1
6879	They look just like me.	1
6880	They missed your son's rash.	1
6881	They need something to break the tension every once in a while.	1
6882	They never drop character while in uniform.	1
6883	They only come out when you're afraid or anxious.	1
6884	They putting a claim on all of my Vicodin.	1
6885	They ruin everything.	1
6886	They said you were almost killed three weeks ago.	1
6887	They say my liver function's better.	1
6888	They scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and I worked my ass off.	1
6889	They scraped off the underpass, probably because it contains.	1
6890	They should be dead by now.	1
6891	They stuck me in catholic school.	1
6892	They tell you that?	1
6893	They were good parents.	1
6894	They were spectacular.	1
6895	They worked.	1
6896	They, uh.	1
6897	They'll lie, because if you knew.	1
6898	They'll track down the parents.	1
6899	They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row but you know you don't have to you can just say no Okay.	1
6900	They're $120.	1
6901	They're alive.	1
6902	They're also delicious.	1
6903	They're being relocated.	1
6904	They're blanks.	1
6905	They're gonna charge you with extra crimes.	1
6906	They're gonna wear off.	1
6907	They're his.	1
6908	they're minty fresh.	1
6909	They're more honest.	1
6910	They're my students.	1
6911	They're normal.	1
6912	They're not here.	1
6913	They're not starving.	1
6914	They're not wool.	1
6915	They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry.	1
6916	They're polyester.	1
6917	They're reacting to something in the plasma.	1
6918	They're shutting down.	1
6919	They're willing to come back.	1
6920	They're wrong.	1
6921	They've given you a great home.	1
6922	Things are different.	1
6923	Things don't seem small anymore, they-- I woke up from a nap and, uh, everything went from really small to really huge.	1
6924	Things got a little heated.	1
6925	Think arteries.	1
6926	Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours?	1
6927	Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years?	1
6928	Think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there.	1
6929	Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet?	1
6930	Think you're up for answering a couple questions?	1
6931	Thinking in here! Brain scans indicate it could be Loa loa disease.	1
6932	Thinks he had a heart attack but didn't.	1
6933	Thirteen is back.	1
6934	Thirteen was right.	1
6935	This all started when he cheated on his wife.	1
6936	This another pet?	1
6937	This bet's got to be a test.	1
6938	This case boils down to he said, she said.	1
6939	This case is a fiasco.	1
6940	This case.	1
6941	This chair will help me do that.	1
6942	This check is for significantly more than what I told you it would take to fund the department.	1
6943	This could be all psychiatric.	1
6944	This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter y.	1
6945	This doesn't change anything between us.	1
6946	This doesn't make any sense.	1
6947	This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?	1
6948	This guy is crazy.	1
6949	This guy went on walkabout.	1
6950	This guy's an idiot.	1
6951	This guy's the only one with symptoms.	1
6952	This has nothing to do with the truth.	1
6953	This hearing isn't about me, Dr.	1
6954	This is a big one, and it's the premium slot.	1
6955	This is a C.T. scan of his liver from ten hours ago.	1
6956	This is a good thing.	1
6957	This is a little scary for me.	1
6958	This is a real issue, and I have to worry about the big picture now.	1
6959	This is a thyroid issue.	1
6960	This is a waste of time.	1
6961	This is Aaron Rodgers.	1
6962	This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid.	1
6963	This is about you covering your own ass.	1
6964	This is all that's left.	1
6965	This is America.	1
6966	This is an ultrasound machine.	1
6967	This is coming from a man whose eyes are wide open.	1
6968	This is completely my fault.	1
6969	This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist.	1
6970	This is from now.	1
6971	This is gonna make me very happy.	1
6972	This is how you plan to get to the boxing game?	1
6973	This is just messing with my feng shui here.	1
6974	This is just you haggling, right?	1
6975	This is my only copy.	1
6976	This is not an exact process.	1
6977	This is our orientation.	1
6978	This is outlandishly childish.	1
6979	This is plan B.	1
6980	This is ridiculous.	1
6981	This is the only way that I can do this.	1
6982	This is the only way you're gonna get your answer.	1
6983	This is treatable.	1
6984	This is what she was opening when she had her attack.	1
6985	This is what you call going quickly?	1
6986	This is what you said you wanted, but you're actually more upset now that her husband knows.	1
6987	This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.	1
6988	This is where you say thank you.	1
6989	This is why we stopped the antiemetics.	1
6990	This is why you get married.	1
6991	This is working fine for me.	1
6992	This is your liver.	1
6993	This is your new reality.	1
6994	This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the patient.	1
6995	This isn't necessarily paranoia.	1
6996	This just feels.	1
6997	This kidney thing is the only evidence you have that he's sick.	1
6998	This man's Ben's hero.	1
6999	this means war.	1
7000	This might be the last time I ever know what he's thinking.	1
7001	This patient died five years ago.	1
7002	This proves nothing because it's not a gun.	1
7003	This swab's for you.	1
7004	This thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood.	1
7005	This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.	1
7006	This was House's idea.	1
7007	This was the fastest way to get it.	1
7008	This week.	1
7009	This whole thing was about your ankle monitor.	1
7010	This will be our last round of questions.	1
7011	This will calm your immune system.	1
7012	This woman seems perfectly healthy.	1
7013	This woman's life is probably better off without sex.	1
7014	This would totally suck.	1
7015	This.	1
7016	Thoracic cavity clear.	1
7017	Those are Vicodin?	1
7018	Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?	1
7019	Those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital 100 bucks every minute I keep them waiting.	1
7020	Those flowers are from last week.	1
7021	Those guys made decisions you supported?	1
7022	Those scars on my ass you may have noticed.	1
7023	Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you.	1
7024	Those who can move on, and those who can't.	1
7025	Those who can, do.	1
7026	Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others.	1
7027	Those who can't teach, teach gym.	1
7028	Those who can't, teach.	1
7029	Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training.	1
7030	Thought she just got here.	1
7031	Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.	1
7032	Thought you only had clinic on Tuesdays.	1
7033	Three tests, three positives.	1
7034	Three times two equals six.	1
7035	Three weeks ago, you never would have slept with a patient.	1
7036	Three years.	1
7037	You're.	1
7038	Yours eluded us 'cause it was caused by antibodies from your rheumatoid arthritis.	1
7039	You've been in a coma for several hours.	1
7040	You've been wrong every time.	1
7041	You've got neighbors.	1
7042	You've got nothing on me.	1
7043	You've got one employee, one volunteer.	1
7044	You've got to be kidding me.	1
7045	You've got two choices, House.	1
7046	You've got your office.	1
7047	You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there.	1
7048	You've had one?	1
7049	You've had your hair cut three times since I've met you.	1
7050	You've never done this before, have you?	1
7051	You've only got her a couple days a week and most of that's spent with a rotating cast of nurses.	1
7052	You've seen Spartacus, right?	1
7053	You--you hope you're wrong for the sake of the patient?	1
7054	You--you meddle and force me into impossible situations.	1
7055	Yup.	1
7056	Y-you mean the treatment will, um.	1
7057	Y-you want to stop seeing each other?	1
7058	You're making a mistake.	1
7059	You're missing my point.	1
7060	You're moving slower.	1
7061	You're not a stranger.	1
7062	You're not allowed out.	1
7063	You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.	1
7064	You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.	1
7065	You're not getting enough oxygen.	1
7066	You're not giving it to me, are you?	1
7067	You're not going to get any rest here.	1
7068	You're not going to jail.	1
7069	You're not gonna believe this.	1
7070	You're not gonna close the wound first?	1
7071	You're not gonna operate on her.	1
7072	You're not gonna put her on bypass?	1
7073	You're not helping Chase or our patient.	1
7074	You're not infallible.	1
7075	You're not supposed to be here.	1
7076	You're not sure of his name?	1
7077	You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle.	1
7078	You're not working for House anymore, which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.	1
7079	You're nothing without me.	1
7080	Uhh.	1
7081	You're on.	1
7082	You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.	1
7083	You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my patient.	1
7084	You're out tonight on conditional parole.	1
7085	You're pregnant.	1
7086	You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?	1
7087	You're pro-infidelity?	1
7088	You're protecting the girl.	1
7089	You're protecting this girl.	1
7090	You're really not good at reading people, are you?	1
7091	You're letting him get inside your head.	1
7092	You're letting in the flies.	1
7093	You're lying, aren't you?	1
7094	What's the plan?	1
7095	What's the problem?	1
7096	What's up?	1
7097	What's with you and Park?	1
7098	What's wrong with him?	1
7099	You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or-- You're confusing me with the clinic again.	1
7100	You were saying?	1
7101	You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman.	1
7102	You were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.	1
7103	You were wrong about encephalitis.	1
7104	You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first.	1
7105	You were wrong.	1
7106	You weren't even there.	1
7107	You weren't trying to undermine my confidence, you were trying to inflate it.	1
7108	You will be eloquent in your loss.	1
7109	You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt.	1
7110	You're getting weaker.	1
7111	You're going back?	1
7112	You're going to Thailand.	1
7113	You're gonna get away from him by turning into him?	1
7114	You're gonna get us killed.	1
7115	You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.	1
7116	You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney.	1
7117	You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.	1
7118	You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.	1
7119	You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?	1
7120	You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub.	1
7121	You're House, right?	1
7122	You're in a hospital.	1
7123	You're in the hospital.	1
7124	You're in the medical profession?	1
7125	You're in the PACU.	1
7126	You're incapable of human connection, so you want everyone to be like you.	1
7127	You're increasing the odds of that every second we waste here.	1
7128	You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.	1
7129	You're just setting yourself up to fail.	1
7130	You're saying he should defer to you?	1
7131	You're scared, aren't you?	1
7132	You're screwing with me.	1
7133	You're so happy with your life you've got nothing better to do at midnight than to come back into work to yell at me?	1
7134	You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds, and he was carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.	1
7135	You're still a doctor.	1
7136	you're still on my mind you're still on my mind I can't see you but I know you're here I know you're here I know you're here I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time I'm glad you changed your mind.	1
7137	You're such a smart kid.	1
7138	You're tachycardic.	1
7139	You're taking my head.	1
7140	You're taking this case because we're running a phase-two trial on an Alzheimer's drug.	1
7141	You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes ?	1
7142	You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.	1
7143	You're the one everyone dislikes.	1
7144	You're the one who brought Andrews in.	1
7145	You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.	1
7146	You're the reason I'm out of the big house.	1
7147	You're thinking lung cancer.	1
7148	You're this way.	1
7149	You're through the aorta.	1
7150	You're trying to deflect.	1
7151	You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from ever intervening, even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.	1
7152	You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here.	1
7153	You're trying to make me look stupid.	1
7154	You're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.	1
7155	You're trying to score points with him at the risk of a patient's life.	1
7156	You're trying to screw with my confidence.	1
7157	You're up against a lifetime of training.	1
7158	You're up.	1
7159	You're using an iPod.	1
7160	You're weird.	1
7161	You're welcome, House.	1
7162	You're angry because your kid died.	1
7163	You're angry.	1
7164	You're apparently asymptomatic.	1
7165	You're beyond fired.	1
7166	You're blaming me?	1
7167	You're blaming the wrong guy.	1
7168	You're bleeding through your bandage.	1
7169	You're clearly getting squeezed.	1
7170	You're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.	1
7171	You're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.	1
7172	You're completely unhireable anywhere.	1
7173	You're covering for him.	1
7174	You're crushing me! Wake up! I think you're having a heart attack.	1
7175	You're DDX-ing?	1
7176	You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.	1
7177	You're doing it to protect them.	1
7178	You're done here, just like every other place you've ever set foot in your life.	1
7179	You're either preparing to fight Pacquiao or you're having one heck of a bad day.	1
7180	Why'd I even have to?	1
7181	Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?	1
7182	Why'd you really do it?	1
7183	Wife keeps the doors on the house locked.	1
7184	Wife of the groundskeeper.	1
7185	Wife used to run a floral company.	1
7186	Wiggle your toes.	1
7187	Wild speculation.	1
7188	Will anyone believe Chase is an actual Doctor?	1
7189	Will he miss a lot of school?	1
7190	Will that still work?	1
7191	Will the endoscopy be painful?	1
7192	Will you be instituting worker safety regulations in your new factories?	1
7193	Will you please just go away?	1
7194	Williams.	1
7195	Years?	1
7196	Yep.	1
7197	Yes! Franklin rules.	1
7198	Yes! Now I'm angry.	1
7199	Yes, absolutely.	1
7200	Yes, and-- and then you die.	1
7201	Yes, and they want a controlling interest.	1
7202	Yes, and your sanity.	1
7203	Yes, as a parent, I empathize.	1
7204	Yes, but we won't know what until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.	1
7205	Yes, but what's it called?	1
7206	Yes, completely unacceptable.	1
7207	Yes, he does.	1
7208	Yes, he is.	1
7209	Yes, I am.	1
7210	Yes, I figured it was from the radiation.	1
7211	Yes, I-- I did have some pictures on that.	1
7212	Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me.	1
7213	Yes, I was on call for neurology.	1
7214	Yes, it gives you a responsibility.	1
7215	Yes, it was nice having my daughter in my home.	1
7216	Yes, it was.	1
7217	Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy storage compartment for .	1
7218	Yes, Jarisch-herxheimer is real.	1
7219	Yes, massa.	1
7220	Yes, please come back, and we'll get you started.	1
7221	Yes, she is.	1
7222	Yes, they do.	1
7223	Yes, we knew what kawah meant.	1
7224	Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan to shake your confidence.	1
7225	Yes, you do.	1
7226	Yes, you were right.	1
7227	You won't need this.	1
7228	You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets.	1
7229	You-- you don't scare her.	1
7230	You-- you understand them.	1
7231	You.	1
7232	You?	1
7233	You'd better be fast.	1
7234	You'd do that?	1
7235	You'd have to hire me first.	1
7236	You'd rather have House fire you than Foreman?	1
7237	You'll appreciate that I left the idiots subtextual.	1
7238	You'll be here six more months, minimum! Sorry.	1
7239	You'll feel better, and she'll feel what.	1
7240	You'll figure something out.	1
7241	You'll get over it.	1
7242	you'll go back to prison.	1
7243	You'll help me.	1
7244	You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.	1
7245	Your altruism was always a symptom.	1
7246	Your arthritis is obviously-- I can pick up my own lawn.	1
7247	Your bigger problem is, the people who design those things aren't idiots.	1
7248	Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister.	1
7249	Your boss uses blackmail, and you question my professional ethics?	1
7250	Your brain is exploding with oxytocin.	1
7251	Your brain knew he's better off without it.	1
7252	Your car is getting fixed.	1
7253	Your catheter bag is empty, despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.	1
7254	Your colleague was stabbed.	1
7255	Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances.	1
7256	Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm.	1
7257	Your daughter has ascariasis.	1
7258	Your daughter is better off without you.	1
7259	Your drinking wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.	1
7260	Your eye.	1
7261	Your February 4th.	1
7262	Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson.	1
7263	Your friend got stabbed.	1
7264	Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with, they've moved on.	1
7265	Your guilt is between you and your wife.	1
7266	Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my patient with renal failure.	1
7267	Your hair smelled like Adams.	1
7268	Your hands are trembling.	1
7269	Your heart rate is speeding up.	1
7270	Your heart said he needed to know.	1
7271	Your heart's beating too fast.	1
7272	Your Honor, may I submit the Chronicle sports page from October 10th?	1
7273	Your Honor, may I submit the sports page from the New Jersey Chronicle on October 9th, 2011.	1
7274	Your Honor.	1
7275	Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.	1
7276	Your job description is doing what Foreman tells you to do.	1
7277	Your job is to be his friend, to stay here and sit with him and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.	1
7278	Your job is to keep this machine running.	1
7279	Your judgment's compromised.	1
7280	Your life outside is over.	1
7281	Your mom and stepdad love you.	1
7282	Your mom didn't hit you, did she?	1
7283	Your mom knows she messed up.	1
7284	Your mom sends you to work with snacks.	1
7285	Your neck.	1
7286	Your occipital lobe is acting up, giving you a migraine.	1
7287	Your old team?	1
7288	Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.	1
7289	Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.	1
7290	Your parents know your call schedule?	1
7291	Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.	1
7292	Your patient is two lungs in a box.	1
7293	Your patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?	1
7294	Your patients love you because you're empathetic.	1
7295	Your patient's stable?	1
7296	Your shoes-- a different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal.	1
7297	Your small airways are collapsing.	1
7298	Your son Ben is in the hospital, at Princeton-Plainsboro.	1
7299	Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.	1
7300	Your son worships him.	1
7301	Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.	1
7302	Your stock price will be completely cured.	1
7303	Your symptoms are real.	1
7304	Your turn.	1
7305	Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a patient into being tested is completely unethical.	1
7306	Your uniforms.	1
7307	Your walk.	1
7308	You're 16.	1
7309	You're a bit late for that.	1
7310	You're a changed man.	1
7311	You're a creative guy.	1
7312	You're a lot taller than I thought you'd be.	1
7313	You're a moron and a coward.	1
7314	You're a peach.	1
7315	You're a prisoner on tier time.	1
7316	You're a smart doctor.	1
7317	You're a smart, successful doctor.	1
7318	You're a sucky clown.	1
7319	You're a TV Doctor?	1
7320	You're a, uh.	1
7321	You're abandoning me?	1
7322	You're about to withdraw from the world for good.	1
7323	You're absolutely right.	1
7324	You're allowed to be at the hospital.	1
7325	You're allowed to go home.	1
7326	You're also addicted to puzzles.	1
7327	You're always right.	1
7328	You're an addict.	1
7329	Wilson my ass! I told you to leave him alone, you son of a bitch! Temper trigger.	1
7330	Wilson needs these lungs.	1
7331	Wilson said it wasn't cancer.	1
7332	Wilson says it's not breast cancer.	1
7333	Wilson.	1
7334	Win-win.	1
7335	With drugs?	1
7336	With great power comes great micromanaging.	1
7337	with me.	1
7338	With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way.	1
7339	With no local symptoms?	1
7340	With polyester uniforms?	1
7341	With respect, Mr.	1
7342	With some difficulty.	1
7343	With the Interferon his English should come back, and the aggression should subside.	1
7344	With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order.	1
7345	with you.	1
7346	Within hours.	1
7347	Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.	1
7348	Won't be fast enough.	1
7349	Won't even trust a co-worker.	1
7350	Won't her chest pain come back?	1
7351	Word is it was a celebratory slap after you completed your first-ever AVM embolization.	1
7352	Work in some boring office?	1
7353	Worked as a nanny.	1
7354	Working in prison, you learned criminals rarely target random strangers, and you've got more money than you know what to do with, so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.	1
7355	Working on a medical case is not a parole violation.	1
7356	Works at an American factory.	1
7357	Works for everyone?	1
7358	Worst case, could be an ectopic pregnancy.	1
7359	Would explain the lack of fever.	1
7360	Would have made my life a lot easier.	1
7361	would have my job, my license, maybe even my house, if I do an unauthorized experiment-- But if--if it is masto-- It's not.	1
7362	Would have seen it on the MRI.	1
7363	Would have seen meningial signs.	1
7364	Would it hurt to do both?	1
7365	Would it make a difference?	1
7366	Would never do that.	1
7367	Would never.	1
7368	Would you look at this?	1
7369	Would you mind watching them for us?	1
7370	Would you please read the caption under the photo?	1
7371	Would you read it, please?	1
7372	Would you shut the blinds on your way out?	1
7373	Would you--would you tell me what's going on?	1
7374	Wouldn't cause hallucinations.	1
7375	Wow, 127 quarterback rating.	1
7376	Wow, twins.	1
7377	Wrinkle pattern's too varied.	1
7378	Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues.	1
7379	Wrong.	1
7380	Yah! What if he's right about the blockage but wrong about the cause?	1
7381	Yeah! It's called an acoustical shadow.	1
7382	Yeah, and then he got her drunk.	1
7383	Yeah, but even a broken doctor's right twice a day.	1
7384	Yeah, but he didn't know that.	1
7385	Yeah, but not for protection.	1
7386	Yeah, but you're hot, so it's easier to put up with.	1
7387	Yeah, damn.	1
7388	Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.	1
7389	Yeah, happily.	1
7390	Yeah, he was.	1
7391	Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you to let the guys know I'm not gonna be able to play on Saturday.	1
7392	Yeah, how did-- I found out where your boyfriend lives.	1
7393	Yeah, how many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?	1
7394	Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says birthday clown.	1
7395	Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.	1
7396	Yeah, I know it's a rationalization, but it went a long way to making me feel.	1
7397	Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.	1
7398	Yeah, I think I read that too.	1
7399	Yeah, I use booze as payment.	1
7400	Yeah, I was saying I agreed with the other one.	1
7401	Yeah, I'll admit to that.	1
7402	Yeah, it is.	1
7403	Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting.	1
7404	Yeah, it's the word might that bumps me.	1
7405	Yeah, like you losing your parole.	1
7406	Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious.	1
7407	Yeah, not one of my best people.	1
7408	Yeah, rats, mice, cockroaches.	1
7409	Yeah, so?	1
7410	Yeah, the fact that we work well together.	1
7411	Yeah, they do.	1
7412	Yeah, well, I don't have a son.	1
7413	Yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea, you know, with us working together.	1
7414	Yeah, well, not this time.	1
7415	Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?	1
7416	Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?	1
7417	Yeah, why?	1
7418	Yeah, yeah.	1
7419	Yes?	1
7420	Yet you were never anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison.	1
7421	Yet.	1
7422	You add them all together, we get.	1
7423	You admire this girl.	1
7424	You allergic to anything?	1
7425	you already kn this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized.	1
7426	You already knew Andrews was drinking that night, didn't you?	1
7427	You also wouldn't have to be at work.	1
7428	You always do this.	1
7429	You always were.	1
7430	You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.	1
7431	You applied for the job.	1
7432	You are a good man who made a mistake.	1
7433	You are making minimum wage.	1
7434	You are so fired.	1
7435	You are.	1
7436	You asked me to ask you.	1
7437	You asked me to call and recommend you.	1
7438	You asking 'cause I surf?	1
7439	You asking me out on a date?	1
7440	you ass.	1
7441	You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew.	1
7442	You blame me.	1
7443	You brazenly defied your boss.	1
7444	You break the law, you go back to jail.	1
7445	You brought him.	1
7446	You called Social Services for real.	1
7447	You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement.	1
7448	You came to the hospital with beer in your pocket.	1
7449	You can cancel the hearing.	1
7450	You can do anything.	1
7451	You can even have it back.	1
7452	you can get that without having sex?	1
7453	You can go to hell! Why don't you kill yourself?	1
7454	You can help with that?	1
7455	You can keep these.	1
7456	You can leave when I have an answer.	1
7457	You can look at the patient file if you want.	1
7458	You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.	1
7459	You can read people.	1
7460	You can recognize that your patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom.	1
7461	You can stay.	1
7462	You can't afford a team.	1
7463	You can't argue away my faith.	1
7464	You can't be embarrassed about a manicure.	1
7465	You can't feel them?	1
7466	You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.	1
7467	You can't go to their house without Foreman's permission.	1
7468	You can't if you're not willing-- Just take care of yourself.	1
7469	You can't just take off.	1
7470	You can't leave the hospital.	1
7471	You can't let him do this.	1
7472	You can't take sex from a sexaholic.	1
7473	You can't take the money, House.	1
7474	You can't, and neither can I.	1
7475	You care that I lied to you.	1
7476	You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning.	1
7477	you cheated on your taxes?	1
7478	You chose me because you thought I'd have your back and I'd think twice about making a decision that would get you fired.	1
7479	You claim you're not screwed up.	1
7480	You clamp now, she could stroke out.	1
7481	You clearly wrote that after the fact.	1
7482	You could aim a lot higher than face paint and seltzer bottles.	1
7483	You could at least let her sleep in the room.	1
7484	You could get more time with him.	1
7485	You could probably just hide the porn in your underwear drawer.	1
7486	You could still pass the gene onto your children.	1
7487	You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?	1
7488	You couldn't round up enough doddering old Guinea pigs.	1
7489	You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.	1
7490	You decided to move your company right after your wife died.	1
7491	You decided to.	1
7492	You did not tell me you were involved in this case when you asked me to do this.	1
7493	You did.	1
7494	You didn't choose me to oversee this because you thought I could be objective.	1
7495	You didn't have a bad lawyer.	1
7496	You didn't have any priors.	1
7497	You didn't hurt anyone.	1
7498	You didn't just burn bridges.	1
7499	you didn't need it.	1
7500	You didn't need to shoot yourself.	1
7501	You didn't say that before.	1
7502	You didn't tell me.	1
7503	You didn't.	1
