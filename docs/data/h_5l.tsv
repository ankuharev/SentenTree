1	Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends to pretend I have a life, when all I did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom, miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.	243
2	you're still on my mind you're still on my mind I can't see you but I know you're here I know you're here I know you're here I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time I'm glad you changed your mind.	230
3	If I were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, I would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way and-- Sorry.	227
4	Telecast, we expect an electric atmosphere in the arena and a sellout crowd of about 10,000 for Rubio versus Santos, two great fighters with illustrious careers who might have been expected to meet a long time ago.	214
5	How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.	209
6	It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.	201
7	I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and manpower just to let this guy watch his mind shrivel and keep his wife miserable.	199
8	Because for some patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication.	199
9	But let me be clear-- you mouth off to one guard, we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell, you break any rules I don't even remember, you can park your ass here for four more months.	197
10	Because he sees insecurity, and when House senses weakness, he pounces, and because his insecurity is the fact that other people can have faith and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.	197
11	No, you're right-- I really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff! The stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.	195
12	Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.	192
13	The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.	190
14	You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it because then with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor because I'd think I could control you.	190
15	Can you dispute the possibility that, had you visited the patient sooner, maybe talked to the wife, been directed to one of the students, that this case might have ended very differently?	187
16	Bob Harris, get on up here with that beautiful family of yours! Bob Harris, folks! Bob, your community activism, charity work, and character represent the finest Cedarville has to offer.	186
17	Working in prison, you learned criminals rarely target random strangers, and you've got more money than you know what to do with, so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.	186
18	I don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response, but, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's on Black Friday, I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.	181
19	Given what's happened, it's understandable that your opinion would color your testimony, but I just want to know what you said, what you did, and what you were thinking at the time.	181
20	Did you and the defendant spend the evening of October 8th watching the Devils game on TV, or did you just read about the game in the Chronicle while concocting this false alibi?	178
21	If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection.	177
22	So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was-- Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter.	176
23	Morning has broken like the first morning blackbird has spoken like the first bird praise for the singing praise for the morning praise for them springing fresh from the word 	175
24	Okay, and I'm sure you're a nice person, but I just moved from Atlanta, and it's my first time at this gym, so definitely don't know who this Taub guy is, but I already agree.	175
25	The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks.	174
26	You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds, and he was carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.	173
27	He comes in with 11 straight knockout wins and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook was able to cut Rubio over the right eye in the tenth round of that last fight.	170
28	Foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard.	169
29	Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training.	168
30	All this time I've been blind to this waking life now I see it everywhere 'cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince yeah and I'm taking it one day at a time Hey.	167
31	The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like not shtupping mommy after the divorce?	167
32	If you had actually been in the room, questioning the patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.	166
33	Right, like group homes, where you're packed in with as many messed-up delinquent kids as possible, foster parents who only take you in because you're a meal ticket.	165
34	And I lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead child.	165
35	It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.	161
36	I vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour celebrating your freedom, justified, of course, by some absurd theory connecting it to donor.	160
37	Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club.	160
38	Either your relationship just blows up like every other non-magical romance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.	160
39	Which means I wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week by child locking all my cabinets, padding table corners, and getting rid of every single magazine.	160
40	You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands.	160
41	our paths, they cross mm-mm yesterday was hard on all of us on all of us == sync, corrected by If you don't know how to use a computer, we will teach you here.	159
42	But House doesn't and I don't, so you can wait till he camps out on your parents' lawn or you can admit you don't live on some higher plane and thank me later.	159
43	So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.	157
44	As for Santos, his handlers tell us that he's done more roadwork than at any time in his career, hoping to prove tonight that he can box for 12 full rounds.	156
45	Now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation.	155
46	So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat.	155
47	I know I'm not any good at being a clown yet, but when I do get a laugh and see those kids' eyes light up, that's how my dad made me feel when I was a kid.	155
48	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== as the new dean of medicine, I'd like to personally welcome all of our new employees and ask, why the hell do you want to come back?	155
49	And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.	155
50	You haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word loyalty, which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty.	155
51	If signing off on everything House does is a pattern, it affects the way House behaves, it affects the way House's team reacts to the way House behaves.	152
52	Gotta build and destroy then rebuild and destroy oh, I'm gonna build, build, build destroy then rebuild and destroy Why am I watching you cut your hair?	152
53	If Foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes, coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.	151
54	And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological-- Your parents didn't love you enough.	151
55	I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees-- You know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.	150
56	House has established that that's okay in his world, or his prank war distracted you, or House makes medicine a game, and you just wanted to beat him.	150
57	Could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.	150
58	I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting someone in my own family, like when my brother tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.	149
59	If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?	149
60	Osler scarf-- only on Fridays, which means you did your residency at Hopkins, which means you're smarter than our interactions would so far indicate.	149
61	That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland.	149
62	To live, oh and I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds gets so hard in times like now to hold on but guns they wait to be stuck by Thirteen.	149
63	Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate, real estate that's been conquered 800 times by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures.	147
64	I may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications, it might be a good time to come clean to your son, let his father visit.	147
65	Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting.	147
66	My theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.	146
67	Personally, I applaud your decision to step down off your cross and get on with your life, but your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.	144
68	Either you're getting her gifts because you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you, or you're getting her gifts to screw with her.	144
69	And your eyes-- the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.	143
70	You have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our patient presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.	143
71	I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.	142
72	But if we can wake up and learn that the entire bank system has gone bankrupt overnight, it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk.	142
73	After 12 years, the active infection would have died down everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests.	142
74	If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.	141
75	Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.	141
76	I had Sophie again last night and Ruby slept in my guest room, which has nothing to do with Phil, who will never be a father to my children.	140
77	Whatever the reason, it boils down to the fact that you may never walk again because House created an atmosphere that promotes recklessness.	140
78	Add that to some peripheral red-green confusion, puts my money-- excuse me, your money-- soon to be my money on a tumor near his pituitary.	139
79	If marriage is feeding and cleaning someone, limiting conversations, to repeating a few simple commands, then I was married to my pet rat.	138
80	Good afternoon, Cedarville! It is my distinct honor to present our annual community service award to one of our most outstanding citizens.	138
81	There are 70,000 people in this country on the active waiting list for a kidney, and less than 10,000 dead people a year to give them one.	138
82	Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the events of February 3, 2012 in patient room 209.	137
83	If all you do is physical therapy and your nighttime version of it, you'll lose your mind faster than you regain those fine motor skills.	137
84	Are you saying that because you believe it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?	137
85	Which could also be caused by choriocarcinoma, which affects the placenta, mimics pregnancy, and causes elevated BP and vaginal bleeding.	137
86	Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.	137
87	You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from ever intervening, even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.	137
88	I am an opportunistic ex-con who just gave you a two-minute sob story as step three in my master plan, and you've offered me $1 million.	136
89	Whatever age, living on the street makes her vulnerable to malnutrition, drug use, H.I.V. , all things which could explain her symptoms.	136
90	The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart.	135
91	You started college a semester late because you left high school a semester late because you had five incompletes in your junior year.	134
92	I usually have a student aide help me set it up, and apparently this year he added extra hydrofluoric acid, which is why it exploded.	133
93	I can't decide whether to take out an I told you so ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.	133
94	The risk is 1 in 4,000 I could die during surgery, which means, if I don't donate, I'm valuing my life at 4,000 times someone else's.	133
95	That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching Martin Brodeur shut out the Rangers.	133
96	If Park is right, he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us, we can cross brain off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.	132
97	I completely understand and almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine.	131
98	A person experiences something that's too difficult to accept, so they create alternate personalities that don't have to accept it.	131
99	I mean, you'll escalate, and then I'll retaliate, and the cycle will continue until we've both gone too far, at which point, I'll.	130
100	He broke out with a rash right after I tested with the wheat-allergy swab, but none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.	130
101	! We have a little problem here! I need backup, I need backup! Alvarez! Mendelson! Sullivan! Mendelson! You're gonna pay for this.	130
102	Interesting that you never showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer.	129
103	Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.	129
104	I've ruled out Wegener's, Berger's, heavy metal poison-- two trains are about to collide, and I'm trying to talk them out of it.	128
105	It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to China.	128
106	One day, I was writing a check to my landscaper, and it suddenly hit me-- $6,000 to take out plants and put in different plants.	128
107	You can recognize that your patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom.	128
108	You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood, and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks I caught in my teeth.	128
109	You told the mom something you want to believe because you don't want to believe that this girl might be doing fine parent-free.	128
110	He makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience.	127
111	Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom, it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.	127
112	Because of his heart problems, but-- Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.	127
113	You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman.	127
114	Imagine what would happen if there was a terrorist attack on the food supply or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.	126
115	No! Male patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?	126
116	Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, I assume that plagiarism is the new black.	126
117	If I had the power to veto him, given all the crap I've put up with over the years, don't know if I could use it objectively.	125
118	His fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about GAD and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.	125
119	A year on dopamine agonists, and he'll be a sex-crazed creep just like the rest of us, completely fascinated by Susie Cooper.	125
120	Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.	125
121	Then my dad got into narcotics, at first just selling but then using too, or he never would have gotten into the slave trade.	125
122	You know, I'm sure you're a nice person and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into, but, really, I'm not interested.	125
123	Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and fecal matter, both human and animal.	123
124	Son of a bitch! Get away from them! House, House! It's a genetic condition! - Shut up! - Genetic! Your father has the gene.	123
125	His vision's back to normal, and if he remains asymptomatic through the night, we'll be able to release him in the morning.	123
126	What you're headed towards now, 14 hours a day in silent prayer, never having a family, never touching another human being.	123
127	Where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose.	123
128	would have my job, my license, maybe even my house, if I do an unauthorized experiment-- But if--if it is masto-- It's not.	123
129	All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.	122
130	Before we proceed any further, Doctor, I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure you intend to perform on the remains.	122
131	There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip.	122
132	In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town-- ladling kittens, spaying soup.	121
133	But like pouring water on a fire, that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash which made his immune system overcompensate.	121
134	Complexes of large, y-shaped antibodies were clogging up your blood vessels, causing your organs to shut down one by one.	121
135	Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.	121
136	You chose me because you thought I'd have your back and I'd think twice about making a decision that would get you fired.	121
137	I think you're a good person and a fine doctor, but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons.	120
138	No, I'm just saying what he's doing doesn't seem rational, which makes me think it's rational in a way I'm not privy to.	120
139	And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail-- That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun.	120
140	Well, you don't have a gun, but you do have my sunglasses, my tennis racket-- I can't imagine why-- Had to kill a mouse.	120
141	Your job is to be his friend, to stay here and sit with him and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.	120
142	Praise for the singing praise for the morning praise for them springing Are you at least gonna call the cops this time?	119
143	But Orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night.	119
144	Things don't seem small anymore, they-- I woke up from a nap and, uh, everything went from really small to really huge.	119
145	Maybe not as much as this guy, but if people told nothing but the truth, the world would probably burn down overnight.	118
146	Just can't stand to think of all those patients going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work.	118
147	I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.	118
148	No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.	118
149	Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fever, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription.	118
150	Heart attack while he was on Interferon rules out encephalitis, but I still think I'm right about the neural symptoms.	118
151	Her lymphoma could have been caused by a virus, HTLV-1, which our patient contracted through having sex with his wife.	118
152	And you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.	118
153	Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.	118
154	Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.	118
155	But when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.	117
156	After you'd administered the Heparin, I see there was a discharge order on the chart, and yet the patient never left.	117
157	We got the patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.	117
158	They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row but you know you don't have to you can just say no Okay.	117
159	You're so happy with your life you've got nothing better to do at midnight than to come back into work to yell at me?	117
160	Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.	116
161	Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey.	116
162	And much as I'd love to hear you contradict me, I have a 7:30 appointment to explore my intimacy issues at La Scala.	116
163	Although he can't take on any new clients right now, he's trying to get mean audition for one of those online soaps.	116
164	Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.	116
165	The plasmapheresis hasn't had time to work, but TTP is our most likely-- Okay, I'm just-- I have to go look for him.	116
166	Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.	115
167	So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.	115
168	So all parents screw up all children, but it makes some huge difference if I keep my daughter here or let her move?	115
169	But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time.	115
170	Wanting to build a connection with your dad and pass on some of the joy that he gave you, that's not stupid at all.	115
171	The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing! I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.	115
172	I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word.	114
173	Of course I do, but this is about your daughter too and I'm not gonna do something like this without your support.	114
174	Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.	114
175	Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.	114
176	'Cause if it's the same as yesterday you know I'm out just so you know because, because our paths, they cross Dad.	114
177	That's what I always said to you, Callie, but I had a problem-- I'm nothing like you! Tell them to do the surgery.	114
178	Orgasms oxygenate the brain, lighting up over 30 different areas and making us forget how boring Susie Cooper is.	113
179	Animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming.	113
180	It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values to determine who gets raises, vacation time, and my respect.	112
181	I don't want to let House sabotage himself by sabotaging me, and I need your guidance and your trust to do that.	112
182	I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday, and I saw everyone else move into the living room.	112
183	Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings.	112
184	Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage-- dehydration.	112
185	Your shoes-- a different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal.	112
186	In the middle of a procedure that could basically save your life, House is actually trying to drag people away?	111
187	Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for.	111
188	No, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one.	111
189	Not only was there a gut tuck, nose tuck, and arse tuck, but her new, fake norks stick out like nuts on a mutt.	111
190	So are we gonna spend the rest of eternity in a lake of fire while pointy-tailed demons poke at us with sticks?	111
191	Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.	111
192	Eliminates most of her insecurity, she's immune to most advertising and can have honest relationships with men.	111
193	And mom's determination to keep dad away, even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.	111
194	And you can tell Taub that he's gonna get the same treatment as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.	111
195	If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.	110
196	I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.	110
197	But if your get-House-out-of-jail-free experiment blows up in your face, it's not my job to get you out of it.	110
198	Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here, I'd never find it because you are more devious-- - Clever.	110
199	Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a szechuan beef.	110
200	The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the Universe, it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect.	110
201	I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.	109
202	Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! How do you keep doing the same thing over and over with the same level of enthusiasm?	109
203	He has Alzheimer's! It's freezing outside, and he's sick! I mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?	109
204	Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.	109
205	We have convened the disciplinary committee to decide the appropriate action that should be taken against Dr.	109
206	The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.	109
207	You were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.	109
208	If we had, the patient would have been anesthetized hours ago, thus unable to go all Chris Brown on her ass.	108
209	She has the right to know! It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.	108
210	I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch, much less run around trying to recruit nurses for yours.	108
211	Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.	108
212	Chesa, after giving the pics an eye or two, I can confirm that Lauren's surgeries cost her some big bikkies.	108
213	By your own admission, if you give the patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.	108
214	Encephalitis makes his brain swell, which causes symptoms that are hard to distinguish from his Alzheimer's.	108
215	And I need a transplant, and they say I don't have much time, so when I heard that you were willing, I just.	108
216	And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.	108
217	And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo.	108
218	[Schuyler Fisk's Waking Life] There's an anchor that's pulling on my heart and it's deep in the water - Hey.	108
219	What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?	108
220	Which is a good thing, because neither GAD nor systemic infection would cause anaphylaxis or tracheal edema.	108
221	You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or-- You're confusing me with the clinic again.	108
222	If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom never took him to a dermatologist?	107
223	Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911, unless they said we were armed, it's low priority.	107
224	In 8 of 12 months time served we have the discretion to grant parole, Friday the 10th, five days from now.	106
225	If you don't mind paying a fortune in child support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.	106
226	If you'd have seen some of the kitchens or the processing plants I have, you'd cook all your own food too.	106
227	If it was an allergic reaction, the Corticosteroids and Epinephrine would have made him better, not worse.	106
228	And do an upper endoscopy to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison, after mommie dearest has given her permission.	106
229	You don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife, not unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.	106
230	You have to believe that every parent screws up every child or you were screwed out of a decent childhood.	106
231	Many of our clients have struggled with addiction, and, if you want to get clean, we'll help you do that.	105
232	If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.	105
233	One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant, and we couldn't even get the kid a marrow match.	105
234	Now, I love you and all, my brother, but not as much as I love my gang of crazy, roided-out Nazi bitches.	105
235	She'd been helping to make the altar breads that morning, but no hard physical work or repetitive motion.	105
236	He wants me to change my visitation order so he can ask Rachel and my daughter to move out west with him.	105
237	And I suspect that you've spent every minute since this has happened trying to answer that very question.	105
238	And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.	105
239	when you treat, and he gets better, and doesn't give Bob Cratchit Christmas day off, you owe me a coffee.	105
240	The wife shut down a floral company to stay home and feed him every meal he's had in the last four years.	105
241	Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a patient into being tested is completely unethical.	105
242	You knew that your patient was at risk for a psychotic break when you brought a scalpel within his reach.	105
243	I'm sure that's true if flag is a euphemism for penis and football is a euphemism for entering a vagina.	104
244	I think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum-- which will kill him if it's a GAD autoimmunity.	104
245	No! No! No! Get the cup! Get the cup! Just drink it! Drink it! No! Grab the cup! Hands behind your back.	104

247	And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.	104
248	Why a man in your position, with your abilities, is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.	104
249	The place'll be a madhouse, especially since it's two miles from the Rubio fight at the exact same time.	104
250	Those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital 100 bucks every minute I keep them waiting.	104
251	I've decided that I would be doing this hospital a disservice if I did anything to change that process.	103
252	I treated an inmate once with similar symptoms after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.	103
253	Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved.	103
254	He told me had a few glasses of wine, and that he shouldn't do it, but he also said that you were good.	103
255	Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died and who's still scared he may not walk.	103
256	A patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use, and obviously you're under hoe and office arrest.	103
257	You know, for someone who asks as many favors as you do, you sure don't make any effort to win me over.	103
258	It's a genetic condition characterized by kidney failure, bronchial myomas, Mees' lines, and deafness.	102
259	I'm not lost I'm just looking for the prince and I'm taking it one step at a time and I'm getting by  	102
260	If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.	102
261	So you just ran away, lived with friends, and partied with guys that you knew your parents would hate.	102
262	But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.	102
263	[Fink's Yesterday Was Hard On All of Us] Where do we go from here and is it real or just It's working.	102
264	Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.	102
265	This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid.	102
266	Surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance.	101
267	House liked poking ant hills with a stick when he was a kid, and now he wants to do the same with us.	101
268	Foreman, members of the committee, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today, I.	101
269	When she opened the Magic 8 Ball, that triggered a switch to a personality with a strawberry allergy.	101
270	The Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather.	101
271	You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my patient is now in a coma.	101
272	Sorry to mess with your world view, but I'm not messed up, so my parents couldn't have messed me up.	100
273	A vitamin K deficiency or scurvy could explain bleeding problems, and pregnancy could exacerbate it.	100
274	That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is not surprisingly wrong.	100
275	Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	100
276	You're not working for House anymore, which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.	100
277	You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.	100
278	You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.	100
279	Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.	99
280	If you ever hear me mention anything about wanting kids, please feel free to punch me in the liver.	99
281	If you're a match, but to increase our odds, we'd like to get your friends and faly tested as well.	99
282	Now, usually with hyperviscosity syndrome, it's caused by an elevated blood count or protein count.	99
283	She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago-- what about dengue fever?	99
284	But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.	99
285	But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here.	99
286	And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait.	99
287	And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that.	99
288	Maybe she likes the sound of my voice, which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her.	98
289	Sometimes, the best way to connect with someone is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.	98
290	Our patient now has a mass in his neck, and his body temp's been rising over the last three hours.	98
291	I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment until you were certain I'd given up looking.	98
292	I need you to solve this, and I need you to do it without making me look like I can't control you.	98
293	I consider these grounds to be a holy place, and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.	98
294	He means it's not lemierre's, but it's still an infection, which is why it's spreading so rapidly.	98
295	And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.	98
296	Because no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance, you didn't buy it either.	98
297	Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.	98
298	You hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.	98
299	You just said you wanted to increase the steroids, and now you want to just-- - I changed my mind.	98
300	Much as I'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole.	97
301	So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights.	97
302	Running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents.	97
303	I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job?	97
304	I can't justify buying video games and private schools when other people's children are starving.	97
305	He said, I've been working at this hospital for 15 years and I'm taking self-improvement classes.	97
306	Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up.	97
307	And you're here in my heart Like when I gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.	97
308	Um, I had an appointment in this part of town, and I absolutely didn't want to miss this meeting.	97
309	You've only got her a couple days a week and most of that's spent with a rotating cast of nurses.	97
310	Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?	97
311	I'm getting by by the way it's you on my mind Would you like to get a drink sometime after work?	96
312	If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here, you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.	96
313	No offense, but, uh, I think it's terrible your dad's closing down all your American operations.	96
314	Hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	96
315	He grabbed it, he apologized for grabbing it, and now he's taking classes because he grabbed it.	96
316	But when I was told the patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.	96
317	But, out of an abundance of caution, my colleague has taken it upon herself to do one more test.	96
318	Weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated BP, causes it to expand and contract.	96

320	The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one.	96
321	The test is designed to determine if you're-- No, I mean your running a test and discharging me.	96
322	There are very serious risks, but if we don't figure out what he has, we can't treat him at all.	96
323	Stress wouldn't be relevant, but anything that increases his adrenalin could have made it worse.	96
324	You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle.	96
325	You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.	96
326	I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I-- we're too busy for rationalizations.	95
327	Only so many hours you can cry and bang on the door before you give up, find something to read.	95
328	Patient didn't tell me the whole story, but he did say he'd be thrilled if we didn't cash this.	95
329	No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.	95
330	Oh, my goodness, it is! Hi, Dean Foreman! Are you not gonna introduce us because we're married?	95
331	She went out of her way to defy me! She needs--damn it, you should just fire her! My apologies.	95
332	His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk.	95
333	Charges of child exploitation against American companies have been blown way out of proportion.	95
334	And she'll feel that way, right up until things get too tough and she has to start using again.	95
335	The part where he said any parent who uses day care should ship their child across the country?	95
336	Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.	95
337	This check is for significantly more than what I told you it would take to fund the department.	95
338	Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you to let the guys know I'm not gonna be able to play on Saturday.	95
339	You made nice-nice with Phil, you decided that he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.	95
340	If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.	94
341	If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff.	94
342	Oh, my God! We need help in here! - Go! - And they're off! You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?	94
343	Need some droperidol in here! I gotta go! He was hallucinating he was being attacked by bears.	94
344	Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier.	94
345	I love my husband, and I would not ever even for a second consider doing anything to hurt him.	94
346	House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?	94
347	He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.	94
348	'Cause even though you don't find my case interesting, you find my interest in it interesting.	94
349	And if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.	94
350	At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.	94
351	We'd like to perform an exercise test, re-create the stress that may have caused his symptoms.	94
352	You don't think that will piss off your cellie even more when he figures it's a different bug?	94
353	You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house and then fled the country for three months.	94
354	Making this yet another interaction with you it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.	93
355	Like some part of him gets what he's putting his wife through, so he tried to-- kill himself?	93
356	I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid.	93
357	I assume you dosed the patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?	93
358	I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes! Chase and Adams can do the test.	93
359	Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?	93
360	And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right.	93
361	[Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On] Near, far wherever you are I believe This is so our song.	93

363	Bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus.	93
364	Bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms.	93
365	While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.	93
366	The legendary night on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.	93
367	Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.	93
368	You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement.	93
369	You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with grammy Adams or cousin Itt.	93
370	Morning has broken like the first morning blackbird has spoken like the first bird Nice tie.	92
371	It sucks, but the Filipino factories suck worse, and the schools would suck if they existed.	92
372	Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.	92
373	Flipd a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.	92
374	Goes to a homecoming party with his buddies, hops on his motorcycle, ends up an organ donor.	92
375	Are you real or just something from wanderlust who can you trust when tears we flower House.	92
376	As long as I don't hear it directly from her, then I can hang on to hope that it's not true.	92
377	At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did because we're not doing anything.	92
378	We can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.	92
379	What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.	92
380	Which means that Foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion.	92
381	The American Associate of Rheumatology wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday, in Atlantic City.	92
382	The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.	92
383	This is what you said you wanted, but you're actually more upset now that her husband knows.	92
384	Your Honor, may I submit the sports page from the New Jersey Chronicle on October 9th, 2011.	92
385	Your patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?	92
386	If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.	91
387	Park's tiger mom and dad were so insufferable, she has to measure their affection in hours.	91
388	Phil had something that he would like to say, so I thought that he should say it in person.	91
389	No, he said, I'm a drunk idiot who thinks he can grab girls' behinds without ramifications.	91
390	House actually presented the case in that way, or are you just trying to make him look bad?	91
391	Getting House out of prison is the biggest decision you've made as Dean of Medicine, right?	91
392	But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs.	91
393	Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom were so indifferent, he has to believe it's a wash.	91
394	Compromised immune system from living on the street could have made her susceptible to HPV.	91
395	And if he's suspended as a result of this hearing, he violates his parole and he goes back.	91
396	And you tested her-- see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.	91
397	Before I ask any of you to sacrifice three months of your life for me, I have a confession.	91
398	We'll see if the Board agrees when I tell them the whole story at my hearing I already did.	91
399	You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes ?	91
400	I've informed Social Services of the mistake and given Jane Doe's description to the cops.	90
401	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you.	90
402	Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it.	90
403	I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.	90
404	How do you know about my first kid-- Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.	90
405	He really needs to know his dad just breezed in and out of his life, drunk and incoherent?	90
406	Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to locate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair.	90
407	He's on Heparin and stable for now, but this could put him at risk for stroke or embolism.	90
408	But unless he wakes up before tomorrow, it's gonna be my signature on that piece of paper.	90
409	We're trying to find money in our budget so we don't have to move our operations overseas.	90
410	What else would explain our symptoms and make our patient go into a coma during that test?	90
411	Wait until they take him back to his room--draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.	90
412	Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or because there is no new girl.	90
413	The fact that she didn't burst into tears tells me that you never thought he was your dad.	90
414	I--yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment, but, uh, I got a flat.	89
415	If there's even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.	89

417	If she had any sense, she'd have stuck him in a facility and jumped on that strange-- Dr.	89
418	Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it.	89
419	Park, maybe you'll like to update our esteemed colleague on the condition of our patient.	89
420	House is here and apparently prepping for an operation that will probably kill a patient.	89
421	House ordered a therapeutic bath first to wash off any residual chemicals from the blast.	89
422	Don't you think it's a little early to be dragging up our baggage in front of each other?	89
423	By the time they get out of solitary, I'll be teaching physics at the University of Fiji.	89
424	Do you think getting beaten up, you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?	89
425	And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing?	89
426	Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye.	89
427	Well, if he has normal pressure hydrocephalus, a tilt table test could put him in a coma.	89
428	Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! [Foy Vance's Be the Song] And when you run This is Mark Sanchez.	89
429	Whatever test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.	89
430	Maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen.	88
431	Maybe I should just accept the patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.	88
432	Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urineest and blood draws every two hours.	88
433	I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with.	88
434	My sister ended up drinking half of her life away and hating me because I couldn't help.	88
435	Foreman is transferring our guy to Princeton General as soon as there's a bed available.	88
436	He keeps imagining symptoms, and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.	88
437	And his urine and blood tests didn't show any evidence of an adrenaline-secreting tumor.	88
438	A second ago, you wanted to run like hell, and now you want to look for secret passages?	88
439	We can't treat an underage patient without a guardian-- we need to call Social Services.	88
440	What would you think if you found out years later your beloved dead wife cheated on you?	88
441	The advantage of fake prescriptions is, you don't have to be a real doctor to write one.	88
442	Then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.	88
443	You heard about my parole, but not about my violent reactions when people steal my tuna.	88
444	I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced Adams has parentally inflicted damage.	87
445	Last thing she ate was strawberry cake, but allergy tests for everything were negative.	87
446	It would have to be pretty far along because the first symptom was just a few days ago.	87
447	If the patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.	87
448	If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?	87
449	If I ever see you in here again, I will write you up, and they will revoke your parole.	87
450	If it's a synthetic problem, more fluid will leak into h chest and his heart will fail.	87
451	No one in mom's family's a match, and as far as she knows, dad has no living relatives.	87
452	House, you're in here because you think you can do whatever you want whenever you want.	87
453	Every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection is time we could be treating him.	87
454	He was saying that things had been better lately between him and I, that I was happier.	87
455	He's saying he's sorry that someone, namely you, overreacted-- namely, by punching him.	87
456	Brown Vestments means you're Carmelites, cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.	87
457	But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above.	87
458	'Cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time - Hey.	87
459	Confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him and then completely forgot about it.	87
460	Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts.	87
461	Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.	87
462	Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to probable.	87
463	What if the scrapings from the bridge chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.	87
464	When Vanessa was ready to quit chemo, Bobby's the one who got her to do one more round.	87
465	You're taking this case because we're running a phase-two trial on an Alzheimer's drug.	87
466	Word is it was a celebratory slap after you completed your first-ever AVM embolization.	87
467	You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.	87
468	You don't think I knew House was gonna tell you to ignore me and not do the ultrasound?	87
469	You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.	87
470	It's got 106 leds, each one sending light to your eyes, slightly different wavelength.	86
471	It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor.	86
472	I'm gonna need to see some stamps, uh, stereo-- just get 'em to me as soon as you can.	86
473	If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist.	86
474	If not for cheating, I might still have a wife, but I wouldn't have Sophie and Sophia.	86
475	Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.	86
476	She obviously earned your respect, passed whatever test you-- I sabotaged her hearing.	86
477	I give him the benefit of the doubt most of the time because I've seen what he can do.	86
478	How about you have one of your peeps on the outside send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?	86
479	Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night.	86
480	Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used.	86
481	But I know that all of you know him as the guy that owns the only gas station in town.	86
482	But then these two believe that the policy of protecting American jobs starts at home.	86
483	Although, to be fair, every man you've ever met has thought about having sex with you.	86
484	What causes an ear bleed, breathing problems, and our runaway's inability to run away?	86
485	The name she registered under seems to be fake, but the address is a foreclosed house.	86
486	You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.	86
487	Made a laceration in the left ventricle about the size of the tip of my index finger.	85
488	I'm smiling because, for the last 12 hours, I've been picturing you with orange hair.	85
489	If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.	85
490	If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.	85
491	Might not be a coincidence that the pain started on the verge of a major life change.	85
492	Most people give the minimum they have to give so they can enjoy what they have left.	85
493	So a few people are nice to you, and your first thought is, Hmm, this seems strange ?	85
494	I didn't put that there! You're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch! What?	85
495	But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point.	85
496	Couldn't stand to lose him as a patient, so you faked his symptom to prove you right.	85
497	Despite what the media would have us believe, you think we live in a very safe world.	85
498	And come down come down innocent way of life Bikes go faster without training wheels.	85
499	At first, I thought it might be frostbite, but I haven't really been out in the cold.	85
500	We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the patient to take off.	85
501	When I left the room, he was telling her about the strippers from his bachelor party.	85
502	The fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her.	85
503	You're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.	85
504	You think you should kill yourself if you become a burden to the people who love you?	85
505	It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss.	84
506	Mom and dad were at each other's throats and the academic crisis was a cry for help.	84
507	I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your house.	84
508	I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.	84
509	If you weren't wrestling with this, I'd say there's something really wrong with you.	84
510	I thought Park and Adams were both right but that their conclusions were both wrong.	84
511	I spent half my time changing diapers and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.	84
512	No, but House has been talking about how badly he wants to remove those prison tats.	84
513	Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.	84
514	So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen.	84
515	Sis and I were talking, trying to figure out how many hospital sleepovers we've had.	84
516	Out of the two donors who didn't walk out, both were negative for a potential match.	84
517	I got a call saying-- I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid.	84
518	His liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels.	84
519	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== So how does a completely healthy teenager have a mini-stroke?	84
520	Fresh plasma will replace the damaged red blood cells that are clogging his kidneys.	84
521	but we infer their existence because of the effect they have on the star they orbit.	84
522	And I'm sure your tests have come up negative, or you would have shut me up already.	84
523	And on a personal note, if my actions caused anyone distress, I sincerely apologize.	84
524	Aahh, she's dying! Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?	84
525	Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice to maximize their niceness?	84
526	We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet.	84
527	When my mother drank, she couldn't handle me, so she locked me in my father's study.	84
528	There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.	84
529	To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression.	84
530	With the Interferon his English should come back, and the aggression should subside.	84
531	You know, if I need someone to watch her while I'm in class or, uh, on an interview.	84
532	You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.	84
533	It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin.	83
534	More curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?	83
535	I thought you'd rather see the company go under in New Jersey than thrive in China.	83
536	Oh, a sudden collapse at your age can indicate a deterioration of the heart muscle.	83
537	Now, many of you may recognize him as coach Bob of our champion little league team.	83
538	No, but digging delusions out of your skin with dirty fingernails could cause both.	83
539	Some nausea, dizziness, and as the tumor shrinks, there will be behavioral changes.	83
540	Hepatic encephalopathy explained why he passed out, why he couldn't move his limbs.	83
541	Great ideas, if dengue fever or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly.	83
542	Carotid dissection, four-inch pulsatile mass in her neck, and some Broca's aphasia.	83
543	Asthma-induced pneumothorax would and might not show up on a posteroanterior X-ray.	83
544	which she'll prove when her parents show up and you start protecting her from them.	83
545	The donor spends a week in the hospita and up to three months convalescing at home.	83
546	Then we have to assume liver failure is just another symptom of whatever she's got.	83
547	That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.	83
548	you already kn this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized.	83
549	It's helpful for society if its members have positive feelings about that society.	82
550	Just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating.	82
551	I told him to tell his wife he cheated, not confess every sin he's ever committed.	82
552	Once we establish rhythm, any accidental movement could crash him back into V-fib.	82
553	Syrinx formed in the subarachnoid space, blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.	82
554	Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.	82
555	She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells.	82
556	I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face, thus proving it's a natural response.	82
557	I could have you checked into a facility that exclusively treats mental disorders.	82
558	Half the time you bring your cars into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.	82
559	Can't take me down You know, there's a bunch of us going to happy hour after work.	82
560	Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy, and I will give you your money.	82
561	Aren't you supposed to be pointing a finger at your own life as a cautionary tale?	82
562	Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.	82
563	Because that's what every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of.	82
564	Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.	82
565	Well, the neighbors put in a pool, so he's been spending a lot of time over there.	82
566	Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee.	82
567	We're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this.	82
568	They scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and I worked my ass off.	82
569	Yours eluded us 'cause it was caused by antibodies from your rheumatoid arthritis.	82
570	Yes, but we won't know what until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.	82
571	You don't like that I'm reassessing my life, that I want to change it, that I can.	82
572	I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.	81
573	It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, everything.	81
574	Laffont, that's only because we temporarily shut down our Diagnostics Department.	81
575	I'm assuming you're thinking something genetic, because-- I'm thinking addiction.	81
576	I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.	81
577	I told the drunk, racist frat guy the proper term is conjoined twin, not Siamese.	81
578	Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest man.	81
579	Or are you just trying to avoid talking about why you don't like working with me?	81
580	Simon Harris filmed the whole thing on his camera phone and posted it on YouTube.	81
581	I realize this is probably a rhetorical question-- why are you stealing my stuff?	81
582	I also think that Taub has brought his little taubettes into work with him today.	81
583	But, well, if it was something in the water, it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?	81
584	And I was the one who questioned her, so, if there was an oversight, it was mine.	81
585	Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.	81
586	Because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.	81
587	what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing problems?	81
588	What if I just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?	81
589	Where's that petition House's P.O. sent over about getting his ankle monitor off?	81
590	You're either preparing to fight Pacquiao or you're having one heck of a bad day.	81
591	Wilson my ass! I told you to leave him alone, you son of a bitch! Temper trigger.	81
592	In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?	80
593	It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.	80
594	I'll give $1 million as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.	80
595	If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.	80
596	If it's hyperammonemic, toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma.	80
597	I should just drive my car didn't it turn out that he'd stolen the hot dog cart?	80
598	So we figured the patient inhaled the extra large dose of hydrofluoric acid and.	80
599	Pregnancy test only infers an embryo's existence because of elevated HCG levels.	80
600	Goin' to turn me around there ain't no one goin' to turn me around ain't no one.	80
601	But they need it more than people with TB or children in Indonesia with no eyes?	80
602	Are you trying to prove that I was distracted, that my judgment was compromised?	80
603	What causes breathing issues, bleeding issues, paralysis, loss of consciousness?	80
604	Thbathroom also tested positive for five different types of pathogenic bacteria.	80
605	The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot.	80
606	Stuff like what employers are looking for, how to turn negatives into positives.	80
607	There's definitely no poisons I could have accidentally been exposed to at home.	80
608	You're done here, just like every other place you've ever set foot in your life.	80
609	You did not tell me you were involved in this case when you asked me to do this.	80
610	You gotta push her neuroses to the point where even she thinks that she's crazy.	80
611	You have enlarged lymph nodes, so I'd like to start by ruling out breast cancer.	80
612	You took the first deal they offered you, because you wanted to punish yourself.	80
613	You want to believe the mythical biological connection excuses being a man slut.	80
614	If only it would explain why we've never seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.	79
615	I thought for sure there'd be some yelling or profanity, possible bloodletting.	79
616	Now that he has the power, he won't be able to resist the temptation to use it.	79
617	No, it was just something I'd been thinking about and I figured, what the heck?	79
618	So you made daddy go away and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.	79
619	So I decided, if I was gonna be the grown-up, I'd rather do it on my own terms.	79
620	I know how to take someone's pain away, how to make a stopped heart beat again.	79
621	I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral.	79
622	I never heard of a neurological problem that causes someone's skin to fall off.	79
623	Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast.	79
624	'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering.	79
625	As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here.	79
626	At that moment, he could only stay alive as long as my finger plugged the hole.	79
627	We can't give you too much pain medication, or we'll make your condition worse.	79
628	We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?	79
629	The sound I make is, moooo! The sound I make is, quack quack quack quack quack.	79
630	Yet you were never anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison.	79
631	You know, the down vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy.	79
632	You see what the patient says about drug use when her mother's out of the room.	79
633	It's been hard for him-- living in their house, driving down the same streets.	78
634	It should open up the airways and buy you some time until the lungs are ready.	78
635	If you'd like to talk to someone, we do have grief counselors at the hospital.	78
636	If your own kids are a scheduling item, maybe you should let one of them move.	78
637	I suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by childhood abuse.	78
638	Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone.	78
639	Other than the fact that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships.	78
640	Meanwhile, he's keeping you here searching for a plan that doesn't even exist.	78
641	Significant because Santos hasn't heard the final bell in more than six years.	78
642	See, the beauty of the plan is that if it works, you think you can control me.	78
643	She wasn't even gonna leave her until I said that I was letting you off early.	78
644	House noticed hormone levels in your blood, and consulted me as an oncologist.	78
645	Hypothetical-- if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?	78
646	I also took $10,000 from the harvest scholarship fund, and I lost it gambling.	78
647	He wandered out of the sandbox into the street, into the path of a moving car.	78
648	He's worried that too big to fail applies to our banks but not our government.	78
649	Hey! House, open up! This is a direct order! Yeah, it's always a direct order.	78
650	He's moving his company to China, and his employees are hanging him in effigy.	78
651	But one of the only things that I can feel okay about is that I never hit her.	78
652	Click the third tab from the left and find the box that says previous entries.	78
653	And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr.	78
654	And some of you may know him as the treasurer of our harvest scholarship fund.	78
655	Because taking him off the antiemetics gave us crucial diagnostic information.	78
656	Well, if you really want to thank me, my department's not really a department.	78
657	Until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was.	78
658	When I started giving away the money, I-- I hoped she'd want to do it with me.	78
659	The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up.	78
660	Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician with political contacts, I'm busy.	78
661	You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my patient.	78
662	Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.	78
663	Yeah, I know it's a rationalization, but it went a long way to making me feel.	78
664	Yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea, you know, with us working together.	78
665	You didn't choose me to oversee this because you thought I could be objective.	78
666	Kovalchuk had two, Arnott and Parise each had one, and Marty got the shutout.	77
667	Maybe we could get a meal after work tonight, if you want some companionship.	77
668	I-I think I want to get a job working as a circus clown, making people laugh.	77
669	If he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the X-ray to do the autopsy.	77
670	Six years ago, I was a nanny in Honolulu for this beautiful two-year-old boy.	77
671	I didn't do anything! Next time I will take your stereo! Ow! That was stupid.	77
672	I kept trying to talk to him, but before long, he'd forgotten, and he seemed.	77
673	I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.	77
674	I admit I was stuck, until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.	77
675	Do we owe this case to your guilt at having ignored your own forgetful mommy?	77
676	And an allergic reaction wouldn't get worse three days after he was admitted.	77
677	Blood smear was clear, and we idiots treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.	77
678	Before we get started, I just want to thank you all for agreeing to relocate.	77
679	We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.	77
680	What I can't work with is someone who's here so she doesn't have to feel bad.	77
681	What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?	77
682	The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.	77
683	The transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.	77
684	That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives.	77
685	T.I.A., thickened pericardium, and now he's bleeding from his nose and mouth.	77
686	You weren't trying to undermine my confidence, you were trying to inflate it.	77
687	I've been trying to persuade the mother, but it's her son, so it's her call.	76
688	It's a little weird without the rash, but it fits all of his other symptoms.	76
689	I spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision.	76
690	On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough to get diabetes even without him.	76
691	Or we'll go to the light box in the lab and know the truth once and for all.	76
692	My advice to you-- figure out what line you aren't willing to cross for him.	76
693	No, some guy almost caught me making out with his wife in their living room.	76
694	So we discussed it a little longer, and House decided to treat with Heparin.	76
695	Same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you.	76
696	Short occlusion time of the artery, when the swelling goes down, you should.	76
697	I gave you time, Leeway, and you decided to do whatever the hell you wanted.	76
698	I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.	76
699	How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the patient?	76
700	I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong.	76
701	Especially since, with the extent of the emphysema, she needs a double lung.	76
702	Ever since then, he's been acting like he's actually trying to get me fired.	76
703	'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.	76
704	Either way, we don't get his temperature above 95, it's not going to matter.	76
705	Doesn't quite make up for never visiting-- Springing you was Foreman's idea.	76
706	And even if it did, they'd blame themselves for the rest of their lives too.	76
707	And if they find out it was me, I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.	76
708	And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better.	76
709	100 bucks says I can find a medical reason why she doesn't want to have sex.	76
710	And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?	76
711	Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help.	76
712	Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.	76
713	Ugh! We hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.	76
714	Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my patient with renal failure.	76
715	You know, that can happen when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.	76
716	You really like the idea, or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?	76
717	In Sunday's sports section, New Jersey Devils goaltender Johan Hedberg was.	75
718	it fits all of his symptoms and exains why he got worse after the steroids.	75
719	I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.	75
720	I started with 10 million, and I couldn't think of a reason not to give 20.	75
721	I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor.	75
722	My dad left me alone to care for my alcoholic mom and raise my baby sister.	75
723	My mom says he was a loving father but always broke and always on the road.	75
724	Since I have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him.	75
725	Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis and cerebral arteritis.	75
726	someone who's related to you, does that empirically make them more special?	75
727	How about damage to her spinal cord blocking the signals from her genitals?	75
728	House thinks avoiding patients allows him to stay as objective as possible.	75
729	I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really-- Oh, no, she could die.	75
730	Dr.Blackenshmurtz will accuse me of writing about the punch after the fact.	75
731	He was getting revenge for the orange hair and rigged it in House's office.	75
732	He's a minor, the mom's his guardian, and it's not even medically relevant.	75
733	But if you feel the need to manipulate me to make me feel useful, then yes.	75
734	Chlorine gas pools near the ground he thought he'd be safe in the top bunk.	75
735	And even if someone wanted to poison him, I don't see how they would do it.	75
736	About your disease, how it made you confess to crimes you hadn't committed.	75
737	What about juice boxes in the break room for the children you'll be hiring?	75
738	Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding.	75
739	Well, I'll try, but they spray so much pesticide I'm surprised we're alive.	75
740	We should do a mental status examination and get a CT of his basel ganglia.	75
741	What makes you-- Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes since this morning.	75
742	Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.	75
743	There's a difference between an isolated riot and the fall of civilization.	75
744	It's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right?	74
745	It's not even clear if our patient just had a heart attack or what it was.	74
746	It's not his spinal cord, it's the wiring between his heart and his brain.	74
747	It automatically slows the car when it senses I'm taking a curve too fast.	74
748	Just because you hung up your lab coat for more money and a bigger office?	74
749	I'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling and try to make a go of this.	74
750	If you're right, calcium channel blocker the lungs have no nervous system.	74
751	Or an anaphylactoid reaction, which could be triggered by certain opioids.	74
752	So you do realize that it is unacceptable to hit someone in the workplace?	74
753	Started with a condom, and we kept it going with our gloves and equipment.	74
754	I have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts by husbands, wives, parents.	74
755	How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?	74
756	But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.	74
757	Cold can be protective to the brain, but there is a possibility of damage.	74
758	A few years of therapy-- Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?	74
759	After he broke out, I wanted to confirm it was gluten before we dosed him.	74
760	We looked at his heart yesterday, didn't see any structural abnormalities.	74
761	Why don't you check his vaccination record before you make another stupid.	74
762	The self-defense classes, you think they're making any kind of difference?	74
763	You're incapable of human connection, so you want everyone to be like you.	74
764	You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.	74
765	You have a problem with House, deal with it, or find someone else who can.	74
766	You know what happened here better than anyone, and you've worked with Dr.	74
767	It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.	73
768	Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.	73
769	It'll raise his temperature enough that his heart should naturally start.	73
770	I was just trying to protect him, like I should have done from the start.	73
771	If Adams is right, he'll spike a fever, get hypotensive, we can treat it.	73
772	If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.	73
773	I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it.	73
774	My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom.	73
775	Mitchell is not Ben's father any more than a sperm donor would have been.	73
776	So I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got the world's largest beer can.	73
777	Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.	73
778	I knew this would fall on deaf ears, but I just kept talking and talking.	73
779	I bet House $100 that I wouldn't get fired after my disciplinary hearing.	73
780	He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans.	73
781	But there is thickening in the lining of the wall of the third ventricle.	73
782	Code Grey! So your position is that your team's disobedience caused this?	73
783	An untreated schizoid disorder he's finally lost the ability to suppress.	73
784	According to Foreman, they're only for DDxing people who are still alive.	73
785	Acute etoh ingestion could have-- hey, paint around them! Who's painting?	73
786	Because his symptoms point towards an infection that spread to his brain.	73
787	We get to stay here with the people who've been so loyal to this company.	73
788	We know there are some issues there, but your bone marrow could cure him.	73
789	Whipple's explains all of his symptoms, including the personality change.	73
790	The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation.	73
791	The neuro symptoms and the rash were both signs of an underlying disease.	73
792	Two hours ago, I found this in your closet in a box with your name on it.	73
793	Your bigger problem is, the people who design those things aren't idiots.	73
794	Yeah, how many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?	73
795	It's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who deserves it.	72
796	Left-sided pain means it could be angina, which is made worse by stress.	72
797	Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.	72
798	I'm an asset to this hospital, an asset you're about to lose to Chicago.	72
799	If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciprocate.	72
800	If you want an accurate patient history, don't ever talk to the patient.	72
801	If it fails, then you will actually have proven that you can control me.	72
802	If it was infection, there would be some sign of it in his blood or CNS.	72
803	Occult choriocarcinoma, which is why we didn't see it on the ultrasound.	72
804	Playing the biology card doesn't change anything except where she lives.	72
805	Renal failure, lung failure, heart failure, all before we started chemo.	72
806	Probably also believes that he thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.	72
807	She traded up, married a lawyer, wants to forget the lowly circus clown.	72
808	How about we don't believe she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?	72
809	I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right.	72
810	Have you ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?	72
811	He's just more comfortable working with me because he's known me longer.	72
812	Could indicate a problem with his heart, which would-- - EKG was normal.	72
813	CT confirms no skull fracture, and looking at her confirms she's not 18.	72
814	After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.	72
815	Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics.	72
816	Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily ever after.	72
817	Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.	72
818	Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their elephant.	72
819	Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and never write with?	72
820	Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry-- I didn't do anything wrong.	72
821	When you say your boyfriend hit you, it means you actually hit yourself.	72
822	The Heparin could cause the patient to bleed into his lungs even faster.	72
823	The student aide was just trying to make a viral video, not hurt anyone.	72
824	Then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.	72
825	There are a lot of good administrators out there, not many good doctors.	72
826	Took a team that was 0-6 all the way to the state finals at Long Branch.	72
827	Will you be instituting worker safety regulations in your new factories?	72
828	Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan to shake your confidence.	72
829	You drove all the way out here just to tell us what you already told us.	72
830	You said, blah blah blah blah blah, deaf ears, blah blah blah blah blah.	72
831	You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old patients was denied.	72
832	Martin Brodeur stops 1 of his 36 saves on the way to a shutout victory.	71
833	I--the bet is-- - But I thought-- - After-- - then-- - I--oh-- if only.	71
834	I'm actually concerned it might be because of the change in management.	71
835	I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.	71
836	If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time.	71
837	If your mom abused you, Social Services won't let you go home with her.	71
838	I'd say I'm in the book, but not the one you'll be reading from now on.	71
839	If it's only in his epithelium, it wouldn't show up in his chest X-ray.	71
840	Now, if you'll excuse me, I ha to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.	71
841	People who are sick are not the only ones who need to be taken care of.	71
842	House can dance all over the rules, gets me knifed, and he gets a pass.	71
843	FiO2 is 93%-- Prison! Sorry I thought I heard everyone else think that.	71
844	He just doesn't think being in the same room as the patient is crucial.	71
845	He sees competing debts with the same person as a disgrace to the game.	71
846	Hereditary angioedema or systemic mastocytosis could mimic anaphylaxis.	71
847	And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something.	71
848	We all knew a psychotic episode was one of the three possible outcomes.	71
849	We would have had to biopsy his lymph nodes anyway to check for cancer.	71
850	What did your screwed-up parents do to screw up your view of parenting?	71
851	Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.	71
852	The Confederacy gave men $21 every six months-- - You poisoned us both.	71
853	The first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment.	71
854	The food that you're eating to stop making you sick is making you sick.	71
855	The wife said she was sure to clear the house for her husband's safety.	71
856	that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our patient.	71
857	Supposed to talk to his P.O. about getting his ankle monitor off early.	71
858	There's a magnet on the fridge they use to open child-proofed cabinets.	71
859	You're trying to score points with him at the risk of a patient's life.	71
860	With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way.	71
861	it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right.	70
862	It's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.	70
863	In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's patients regress to old routines.	70
864	If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.	70
865	On all of us Ah! Where do we go from here where do we go Dinner later?	70
866	Or something is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree.	70
867	No, he heard the nurses talking about her, that she was short on time.	70
868	Neither of you stepped out between periods, get beer, pick up a pizza?	70
869	So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect.	70
870	Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.	70
871	She uses crushed aspirin in the water to make the flowers last longer.	70
872	His family history of melanoma may have affected his cellular outlook.	70
873	I do have an imaginary colleague who's just sent me an imaginary page.	70
874	Explains the neurological impairment as well as the normal blood work.	70
875	From a corporation that's going through a very public belt-tightening.	70
876	First 17 messages were cute, but-- I'm putting the band back together.	70
877	He lost his wife and kids because she couldn't stop giving money away.	70
878	Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away.	70
879	And that's from a guy with one alimony and two child support payments.	70
880	Belief implies a level of giving a crap that I am never gonna achieve.	70
881	Better to have schtupped and lost then never to have schtupped at all.	70
882	Also, he started a betting pool on which kid is yours and which isn't.	70
883	We're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit and check back in two minutes.	70
884	We think you were having sex, but memory loss could also be a symptom.	70
885	The facts of this case, on the other hand-- the facts are in the file.	70
886	Then don't believe her, and start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	70
887	Then he'll doze off, and then in a couple hours, he'll thank us again.	70
888	Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?	70
889	That would mean that every symptom after his T.I.A. was a coincidence.	70
890	Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you.	70
891	There's an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery of his brain.	70
892	You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here.	70
893	You knew the second you told me about this case that I'd get involved.	70
894	You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here.	70
895	Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage to wash 'em out with water.	69
896	I'm Adele Brown from Social Services, and this is-- I'm Ellen Rogers.	69
897	If we both do our jobs, we might actually get him through his parole.	69
898	If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick.	69
899	If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden.	69
900	Okay, maybe we need to take a minute here and give Callie some space.	69
901	Mini-mental, CT, and get a hair sample to check for past cocaine use.	69
902	No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him.	69
903	So you guys are trying to manipulate me by playing good cop/good cop?	69
904	So, at 6:00 a.m. , the patient wakes up, and the first thing he sees.	69
905	So are you! She's found something she wants to build her life around.	69
906	So that must have been nice, having Ruby and the baby under one roof.	69
907	Our stock dropped a couple points today with the news that he's sick.	69
908	Probably because he just turned 40 and still goes by the name Tommy .	69
909	She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last ten years.	69
910	I have no idea what flavor you are, so I decided to cover the spread.	69
911	I mean, even if you are right about it, why take your word over mine?	69
912	How could this be happening to my own daughter without me knowing it?	69
913	House took your results after he manipulated you into providing them.	69
914	House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a patient.	69
915	Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.	69
916	Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG.	69
917	But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.	69
918	Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it.	69
919	Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game.	69
920	Well, then, these giant balls of medicine are not gonna work anymore.	69
921	We'll check catecholamines for pheo and run an expanded opioid panel.	69
922	Which is why you should accept his apology and come back on the team.	69
923	That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.	69
924	The antibiotics we gave him actually started destroying the syphilis.	69
925	The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open.	69
926	The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check foany abnormalities.	69
927	There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?	69
928	This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the patient.	69
929	Your Honor, may I submit the Chronicle sports page from October 10th?	69
930	Yah! What if he's right about the blockage but wrong about the cause?	69
931	Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says birthday clown.	69
932	You like anything dangerous-- monster trucks, motorcycles, fireworks.	69
933	You manufactured conflict with me so eventually you could let me win.	69
934	You should have told me you were treating an underage clinic patient.	69
935	It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to judge the new one.	68
936	It's not like I want to be cut open and have a part of me taken out.	68
937	I've tapped over 30 guys and never wanted to see most of them again.	68
938	I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for China.	68
939	If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine, then I'd say you're a moron.	68
940	Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year.	68
941	Please accept this on behalf of all of us and know that we love you.	68
942	No wonder you have such insight into my relationship with my babies.	68
943	So it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.	68
944	Says the doctors here can no longer be objective since the stabbing.	68
945	Probably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.	68
946	I held the needle in front of the patient that set off his paranoia.	68
947	I hung it up because someone had to run this place after cuddy left.	68
948	I mean, do you think my father would have done that for ten minutes?	68
949	I need to get away from House and everything that reminds me of him.	68
950	His mother feels it's better to do the test at a different hospital.	68
951	His symptoms will go away and then I can show him he was never sick.	68
952	From ashes to ashes from dust to dust I found your stuff in storage.	68
953	He has a heart problem but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.	68
954	He has to base his decisions on what's best for the entire hospital.	68
955	Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system.	68
956	Actually there's two, but we don't have enough jell-o for the first.	68
957	We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.	68
958	Take him off antiemetics, do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds.	68
959	This is a real issue, and I have to worry about the big picture now.	68
960	Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others.	68
961	Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with, they've moved on.	68
962	You don't have to work for House, but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.	68
963	You sure you don't want to wait till after he answers your question?	68
964	You think I'm not-- you think I'm not gonna go to Foreman with this?	68
965	In my opinion at the time, it was the rash that was gonna kill him.	67
966	Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.	67
967	I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.	67
968	Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.	67
969	Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something.	67
970	It was wrong of me to confront you about taking Rachel to Portland.	67
971	If we add clotting disorder to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.	67
972	I walk in in a suit, and they're gonna put their best foot forward.	67
973	Oh, we kiss and cuddle, but neither one of us is interested in sex.	67
974	Or you're terrified of intimacy, which is why you're a serial slut.	67
975	Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Social Services report came in on your mom.	67
976	So you're zen about it but won't let go of your anger toward House?	67
977	So we agreed that he would come in, but wouldn't touch the patient.	67
978	Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.	67
979	She said, I've been a fellow for two months, and I'm kind of weird.	67
980	Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment?	67
981	I know this is hard, but please tell me exactly what happened next.	67
982	His heartbeat's doing well, and his body temperature is stabilized.	67
983	He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.	67
984	Her mom hates me, so she can't visit, she ain't accepting my calls.	67
985	Hey, did you know your ex-wife still lives right behind this place?	67
986	He's an addict, and he will put himself back in jail over a puzzle.	67
987	Could be your not-so-subtle way of implying this was House's fault.	67
988	And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.	67
989	We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian children.	67
990	Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam.	67
991	To give you the excitement you need so you don't go looking for it.	67
992	Tomorrow morning, I am supposed to sign a piece of paper that will.	67
993	Thinking in here! Brain scans indicate it could be Loa loa disease.	67
994	You don't want to listen to me, then I don't want to listen to you.	67
995	You skipped over the actual DDX, and now you're averting your eyes.	67
996	You think he knows anything about women who don't want to have sex?	67
997	You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?	67
998	It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask brutally enough.	66
999	More annoyingly, by having me do it and deal! Of course, you know.	66
1000	Last month, I had an incident involving another P.P.T.H. employee.	66
1001	Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills.	66
1002	Now that we know what it is, he'll need treatment, but he'll live.	66
1003	Search the home for toxic plants, methyl bromide, any medications.	66
1004	Swelling that fast and localized has to come from the lymph nodes.	66
1005	I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.	66
1006	I just believe people are capable of more than you do, apparently.	66
1007	House's comments will, of course, have no bearing on this hearing.	66
1008	I break a rule, no one gets hurt, but you kick me off my own case?	66
1009	Especially after years of following that much smaller third organ.	66
1010	Foreman will find out you're taking this case, and he'll bust you.	66
1011	Getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board.	66
1012	Chase and Taub are back! You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?	66
1013	And if we induce v-fib, odds say that we'll be able to revive him.	66
1014	As long as you keep dealing with your doubts in the same way then.	66
1015	As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead man.	66
1016	We're warming his blood outside of his body, then putting it back.	66
1017	We had a patient who was going to die without an AVM embolization.	66
1018	The artery that's bringing blood to your brain, it's coming apart.	66
1019	The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying.	66
1020	There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.	66
1021	Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?	66
1022	You're crushing me! Wake up! I think you're having a heart attack.	66
1023	Your boss uses blackmail, and you question my professional ethics?	66
1024	Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?	66
1025	You know that close to 1% of the population identifies as asexual?	66
1026	You know, the least you could do is laugh at a dying lady's jokes.	66
1027	You think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life?	66
1028	Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives.	65
1029	Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.	65
1030	It means I've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.	65
1031	If we had more data on the exact type of melanoma his father had.	65
1032	If you're speaking as a team member, then I'd say you're a moron.	65
1033	I-I did something stupid last night, but it was a one-time thing.	65
1034	If she dies, we'll be in the middle of a brand-new investigation.	65
1035	I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the patient.	65
1036	Patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.	65
1037	Misidentified as Martin Brodeur in a photo caption and box score.	65
1038	Not enough to test abnormal, just more than his brain is used to.	65
1039	So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years.	65
1040	Rhabdomyolysis fits the vomiting, pigmenturia, and renal failure.	65
1041	Plenty of nasty stuff to get into during the middle of the night.	65
1042	Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity.	65
1043	House's complete lack of concern is evidence of his deep concern?	65
1044	His thyroid levels were within normal range when he was admitted.	65
1045	Fine, then give me a team I don't have to put in quotation marks.	65
1046	'Cause he'll be dead if he doesn't get one in the next few hours.	65
1047	'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.	65
1048	Either way, it's more interesting than whatever you're doing now.	65
1049	24-year-oldwater treatment worker with pyrexia and double vision.	65
1050	And then when you got tired of being a rebel, you just went home.	65
1051	Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.	65
1052	We only really started talking again because of the reenactments.	65
1053	We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late.	65
1054	Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.	65
1055	That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	65
1056	The daughter said that her mother died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	65
1057	The Heparin decision didn't have anything to do with the outcome.	65
1058	Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot.	65
1059	There's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest X-ray.	65
1060	You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub.	65
1061	With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order.	65
1062	Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues.	65
1063	You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?	65
1064	In which case, I will be teaching you my secret homey handshake.	64
1065	It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank.	64
1066	I'm sorry the first time I had both of you together I had to wk.	64
1067	It's your choice to make House a useful tool or a monkey wrench.	64
1068	It stumped two E.R. Docs and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.	64
1069	I was having sex at a motel when I started to feel light-headed.	64
1070	I'll watch the baby again, and you can get a real night's sleep.	64
1071	If you hadn't been screwing with me and put the idea in my head.	64
1072	If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.	64
1073	I think you should give House permission to go to Atlantic City.	64
1074	I specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.	64
1075	I would love for him to get out of here before the market opens.	64
1076	No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work.	64
1077	My parents have a lot of money, but they didn't make it legally.	64
1078	Not going back, and that look of shock is elitist and offensive.	64
1079	Root canal, if done correctly, doesn't look like kidney disease.	64
1080	Since I have my kids for the next two days, I need a babysitter.	64
1081	Our patient can't wait for a transplant that's never gonna come.	64
1082	She's smoking hot, and it's not his job to protect her marriage.	64
1083	I just wanted to make sure you were cool if I go to without you.	64
1084	I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.	64
1085	I moved back home because it was too drafty at the four seasons.	64
1086	His company's lost one third of its value since he was admitted.	64
1087	I could add some Mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.	64
1088	Halfway through the perimetry exam, her tunnel vision went away.	64
1089	He believes that disagreement and mistrust lead to better ideas.	64
1090	He'll notice it eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.	64
1091	Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.	64
1092	But if you're having doubts about Chicago, I can call them back.	64
1093	But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?	64
1094	'Cause if he admits he was in a fight, then he goes to the hole.	64
1095	Chi Park as a result of her actions on October 7th of this year.	64
1096	Cuddy dark will waste his afternoon chasing conspiracy theories.	64
1097	Cuddy's way didn't fail because she didn't try to control House.	64
1098	Does there have to be some dramatic moment where the skies part?	64
1099	A chemistry demonstration he was doing for his class went wrong.	64
1100	All of the shift nurses had their hands full with a double code.	64
1101	Blue Veil means you're a postulant, haven't taken your vows yet.	64
1102	Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best.	64
1103	Well, if I'm gonna die, I might as well do it with a clean soul.	64
1104	We also have a course in how to talk to someone in an interview.	64
1105	What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.	64
1106	When your dad showed up unexpectedly, House have a hand in that?	64
1107	Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them.	64
1108	While I was on the operating table, it didn't feel like a dream.	64
1109	That's right, all those babies with aids, they're just using us.	64
1110	Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.	64
1111	That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.	64
1112	That's an insult to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.	64
1113	Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.	64
1114	Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years?	64
1115	This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.	64
1116	Your catheter bag is empty, despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.	64
1117	you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you, didn't you?	64
1118	Listen, I'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity.	63
1119	I've known my husband longer with his Alzheimer's than without.	63
1120	Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.	63
1121	I'm doing my job, part of which is to make sure House does his.	63
1122	I'd love to go myself, which is kind of why I have to stop him.	63
1123	If everyone did that, we'd never find a donor for anyone again.	63
1124	I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words.	63
1125	Number three went to a baseball game the day before he donated.	63
1126	Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up.	63
1127	My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean, and my boss grabbed my behind.	63
1128	So as much as my better nature really wants to give you a pass.	63
1129	So best-case scenario, I've just had a glimpse into his future?	63
1130	Squamous cell middle ear tumor could have caused the ear bleed.	63
1131	She said when her mom slips again, she didn't want to be there.	63
1132	I got an order here to deactivate and remove his ankle monitor.	63
1133	I didn't even know you could do this! Start the blood thinners.	63
1134	I knew House wouldn't take the case unless I ruled out anxiety.	63
1135	House, if it's total paralysis, he must have-- not necessarily.	63
1136	He didn't get that name because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.	63
1137	He lives in pennsauken under a different name, Mitchell Gordon.	63
1138	But every unit of plasma can have up to 25 contributing donors.	63
1139	But it must've been important that you stayed for both of them.	63
1140	Decided to have an all-night game in Brandon Broome's basement.	63
1141	Does anyone have a position on our patient's medical condition?	63
1142	And check with admitting for the net worth of all new patients.	63
1143	Allergies, paresthesia, vision loss, changes in blood pressure.	63
1144	Are you sure there's no one on the father's side of the family?	63
1145	Ben, you keep your grades up, you can do anything in the world.	63
1146	Another question is, could the paresthesia be caused by an STD?	63
1147	We can also provide clothes for the interview if you need them.	63
1148	We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal.	63
1149	What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?	63
1150	Trousseau's syndrome could send clots, cause the ischemic foot.	63
1151	Turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.	63
1152	There's a little mass here, and I'd like to get it checked out.	63
1153	They just don't usually broadcast all of them at the same time.	63
1154	They need something to break the tension every once in a while.	63
1155	This kidney thing is the only evidence you have that he's sick.	63
1156	You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt.	63
1157	You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets.	63
1158	You could aim a lot higher than face paint and seltzer bottles.	63
1159	You could probably just hide the porn in your underwear drawer.	63
1160	You get a drop-down menu sorted by patient name and department.	63
1161	In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.	62
1162	In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors.	62
1163	Is there some black market in Insulin that I don't know about?	62
1164	Mommy gets a rest, daddy gets more time with his little angel.	62
1165	It's the greatest mystery there is-- the theory of everything.	62
1166	I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned house with mold.	62
1167	I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.	62
1168	It is crazy, but House doesn't do crazy just for crazy's sake.	62
1169	I'm an ex-con trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by.	62
1170	I'd like to try forcing an oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.	62
1171	If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.	62
1172	I thought I was here to treat the patients, not entertain you.	62
1173	I told you, I was sitting at my desk when the attack happened.	62
1174	Okay, cross out everything that doesn't appear in every alter.	62
1175	Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility.	62
1176	Peek-a-boo! Why would Anita tell her husband about our affair?	62
1177	My heart will go on House, I haven't forgotten our friendship.	62
1178	My problem is you thinking you're always one step ahead of me.	62
1179	My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.	62
1180	She can't share her problems with him, or plan for the future.	62
1181	I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.	62
1182	I know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.	62
1183	House was like the child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang.	62
1184	He never eats or drinks anything that we haven't made at home.	62
1185	He's just taken up performing and it's very stressful for him.	62
1186	And extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.	62
1187	A couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.	62
1188	A couple nights a week with each kid may make you feel better.	62
1189	We were talking about how you got the abrasions on your knees.	62
1190	Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.	62
1191	When he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small problems.	62
1192	The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.	62
1193	Transfusing his platelets will keep him healthy while we wait.	62
1194	You're increasing the odds of that every second we waste here.	62
1195	Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy storage compartment for .	62
1196	I'm sorry about earlier, but we needed to provoke a reaction.	61
1197	Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals.	61
1198	Maybe we find you a new hobby, one you're a little better at.	61
1199	I'll never be able to explain, never tell her how sorry I am.	61
1200	I'm glad you feel that way, because I do have a favor to ask.	61
1201	I'm only moving it to China because I'm craving egg foo yung.	61
1202	If you had been in that room, maybe that could have been you.	61
1203	I--I can't get all 20, but once I get out-- Give us a minute.	61
1204	If my father had lived, everything would have been different.	61
1205	I thought it was interesting she couldn't accept that coffee.	61
1206	I tried to learn when we got married, but I just-- it's okay.	61
1207	Once you drink this, should get an attack almost immediately.	61
1208	No, if they're having sex, it's probably with their genitals.	61
1209	My brother, the General here, gots the green-apple quickstep.	61
1210	Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm.	61
1211	Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.	61
1212	Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.	61
1213	Pull! I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss.	61
1214	Put out an APB for a car with a man-shaped dent in the grill?	61
1215	I say we put him out of his misery and bring out Emma's cake.	61
1216	I mean, he was closer to Callie than I was, and I missed him.	61
1217	How does briefly wishing I was screwed up make me screwed up?	61
1218	How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial?	61
1219	His EKG, cardiac enzymes, and catheterization are all normal.	61
1220	House on patient safety, Doctor, it is your duty to speak up.	61
1221	I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room.	61
1222	Flout my authority, make the hospital look bad, back to jail.	61
1223	Having a family doesn't exempt me from social responsibility.	61
1224	He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.	61
1225	Going overseas a while, and that seems like a huge sacrifice.	61
1226	He's even had defendants thank him after they were sentenced.	61
1227	But if there's no boyfriend, where did the bruises come from?	61
1228	'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives.	61
1229	Damn! I just realized I'm late for my anger management class.	61
1230	Do you have a cleaning lady who might bring her own supplies?	61
1231	Does a friend watch you where it's happening, and wonder why?	61
1232	Doesn't explain why he vomited so hard he ripped his insides.	61
1233	Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.	61
1234	And could, but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes.	61
1235	And he was all, 'cause of how Diaz kicked his ass last month.	61
1236	And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are.	61
1237	And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag.	61
1238	After what happened to you, don't you wanna remake your life?	61
1239	And you can't know because you can't think clearly about her.	61
1240	And you're not sure if he has brain damage from being frozen.	61
1241	Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks.	61
1242	Because the patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.	61
1243	Angiography showed a hemorrhagic site in the left lower lobe.	61
1244	We also need to confirm and treat whatever's making him sick.	61
1245	We gotta get her BP up before her organs start shutting down.	61
1246	We should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.	61
1247	Weathers, I am sure you're right, but we need to be thorough.	61
1248	What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis.	61
1249	Which we won't know, because the E.R. put him on antiemetics.	61
1250	The body slows down when it cools, but it doesn't fully stop.	61
1251	The jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.	61
1252	the motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.	61
1253	The team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation.	61
1254	There is something in this world you are undeniably great at.	61
1255	Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.	61
1256	Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.	61
1257	They scraped off the underpass, probably because it contains.	61
1258	You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.	61
1259	You already knew Andrews was drinking that night, didn't you?	61
1260	You can't if you're not willing-- Just take care of yourself.	61
1261	You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.	61
1262	You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument.	61
1263	You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio fight?	61
1264	You showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.	61
1265	Instead of building bunkers, you should be getting boosters.	60
1266	Isn't that getting this whole parenting thing ass backwards?	60
1267	Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.	60
1268	makeup, perfume, birth control method, her Hello Kitty doll.	60
1269	Maybe she was opening a present that triggered the reaction.	60
1270	It probably doesn't mean anything, but we want to make sure.	60
1271	I'll just tell you what I was-- Ah, ah, ah, ah! No spoilers.	60
1272	I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.	60
1273	If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor.	60
1274	If only burnt lungs explained the passing out and paralysis.	60
1275	I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.	60
1276	I wasn't exactly wrestling with great theological questions.	60
1277	I wouldn't be doing this if I thought there was another way.	60
1278	No sign of any electrical abnormalities in the right atrium.	60
1279	My first job out of law school was at the health department.	60
1280	Not sure that's-- - What if I bet him $200 I will get fired.	60
1281	move the company and cost thousands of employees their jobs.	60
1282	So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head.	60
1283	Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more humanely.	60
1284	Pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population.	60
1285	She got worse after being on steroids, so autoimmune is out.	60
1286	She lives at her mom's now on account that she lost her job.	60
1287	She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.	60
1288	I heard about your conversation with the patient's daughter.	60
1289	I made a mistake, and now it's gonna end up ruining my life.	60
1290	I don't care how sick your spouse gets, you don't jump ship.	60
1291	Fridge has more spinach and broccoli than a farmer's market.	60
1292	He didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?	60
1293	Get out of here, House! Start the patient on plasmapheresis.	60
1294	But I don't think that's gonna change your opinion, because.	60
1295	Course-corrected two peoples' wildly screwed-up world views.	60
1296	And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?	60
1297	25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got.	60
1298	Adams, he endangered himself, and he endangered the patient.	60
1299	As in routine vaccines against stuff that is actually scary.	60
1300	At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?	60
1301	Awkward! He knocked up two different women at the same time.	60
1302	The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.	60
1303	That the heart does go on My patient is running out of time.	60
1304	Try to find the patient some blood that's closer to his own.	60
1305	The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher.	60
1306	There's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people.	60
1307	They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry.	60
1308	You decided to move your company right after your wife died.	60
1309	You had no right! This is none of your business! - I didn't.	60
1310	Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?	59
1311	I've watched more of him disappear than I ever got to know.	59
1312	I was told that this might be my last chance to see my son.	59
1313	I'm beginning to think we should just go with House's idea.	59
1314	If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call.	59
1315	If you think you're up to this job, it's time to lose them.	59
1316	I'll admit I was weak for a moment, but I'm not doing this.	59
1317	I want to build a connection with him, pass on some of the.	59
1318	Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter.	59
1319	Or is everyone afraid to say what they think the answer is?	59
1320	Micropsia, bleeding, tachycardia, and difficulty breathing.	59
1321	Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride.	59
1322	Please read the highlighted text at the bottom of the page.	59
1323	She's a homeless girl who's captain of the volleyball team.	59
1324	How many times have you thrown the truth in people's faces?	59
1325	I assume, from the silence, that Chase has had a Brazilian.	59
1326	Hey, maybe I don't have my father's crummy genes after all.	59
1327	I claim this burger in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain.	59
1328	Fortunately, only the knife tip reached the cardiac muscle.	59
1329	He'd never admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you.	59
1330	Get me a micro-vascular clip tray as well as the occlusion.	59
1331	But when you think about the consequences-- Okay, let's go.	59
1332	But you agree that empathy is a useful quality for doctors?	59
1333	Checked the anesthesia sheet, pressure was fine throughout.	59
1334	En the best-intentioned parents end up damaging their kids.	59
1335	Endoscopy didn't reveal any lesions in the small intestine.	59
1336	Big sinus bleed could be sinusitis and a bleeding disorder.	59
1337	At this rate, I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.	59
1338	Better go do some of those clinic hours I recently doubled.	59
1339	Because nothing will ever change how I feel about you guys.	59
1340	Who do you think was at fault for what happened to you, Dr.	59
1341	The liver failure could be from intraoperative hypotension.	59
1342	That woman sees everything to do with her daughter through.	59
1343	They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.	59
1344	This might be the last time I ever know what he's thinking.	59
1345	This thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood.	59
1346	Three weeks ago, you never would have slept with a patient.	59
1347	You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.	59
1348	You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.	59
1349	Your job description is doing what Foreman tells you to do.	59
1350	You know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.	59
1351	It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.	58
1352	It's like you getting two women pregnant at the same time.	58
1353	I've been considering applying to Doctors Without Borders.	58
1354	It means he's not paranoid, is an idiot, and was poisoned.	58
1355	I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.	58
1356	I'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.	58
1357	Patient had V-tach in the echo lab, so we capped him, but.	58
1358	No, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.	58
1359	My father keeps up a good front, but he's just like Emory.	58
1360	Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect.	58
1361	Ow! I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise.	58
1362	I pay court-ordered child support, and, frankly, it's, uh.	58
1363	I don't care what killed him! It's called Alport syndrome.	58
1364	Everybody doesn't lie, cheat, or steal from their friends.	58
1365	He probably would have taken other kids to the playground.	58
1366	Get in line for meds! Asofa! Why you keep helping him out?	58
1367	Boy meets girl, girl falls for boy, boy says, I'm asexual.	58
1368	By breaking the rules, not caring what anyone else thinks.	58
1369	And how did these orange smudges get on the patient files?	58
1370	And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.	58
1371	A life of perpetual enclosure and almost complete silence?	58
1372	All I care about right now is that my husband gets better.	58
1373	Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing in his office?	58
1374	Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.	58
1375	Are you asking me if I think my wife is trying to kill me?	58
1376	We caused it by giving him steroids when he first came in.	58
1377	We got a guy in an ambulance heading to Princeton General.	58
1378	We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.	58
1379	We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.	58
1380	We probably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this.	58
1381	We used to walk and get some every morning at that bakery.	58
1382	What if I die, and one day she finds out I cheated on her?	58
1383	The fourth thing you said was, where's my old environment?	58
1384	The hospital brought in a consultant to work on the lungs.	58
1385	The immunosuppressants we gave him sent it into overdrive.	58
1386	There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.	58
1387	That was to show Adams that mommie dearest hadn't changed.	58
1388	They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.	58
1389	Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister.	58
1390	You do a tilt table test, see how his heart rate responds.	58
1391	You know, if you wanted, you could put an end to all this.	58
1392	I'm trying to survive on one a day for the next few days.	57
1393	It can make you very, very late for very important dates.	57
1394	I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.	57
1395	It seems like Graves disease or some other thyroid issue.	57
1396	It was ugly and painful, and she went with me hating her.	57
1397	It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm found in feces.	57
1398	I was gonna leave that implied, but, yes, colossal drunk.	57
1399	If I get this done in five minutes, she won't stroke out.	57
1400	I thought you said that guy was one of your best doctors.	57
1401	On the plus side, I can now program my DVR from my phone.	57
1402	Or his liver's so far gone it can't even produce enzymes.	57
1403	Patient's having an allergic reaction to donor platelets.	57
1404	People understand getting hit more than what my mom does.	57
1405	My college roommate is the editor of the Yale Law Review.	57
1406	My option to sell Barton Foods at $34 is about to expire.	57
1407	Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second.	57
1408	Second-guessing my best doctors shouldn't be one of them.	57
1409	Since Claudine left, no one's been inputting the numbers.	57
1410	Start the patient on statins, and do a biopsy to confirm.	57
1411	She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own.	57
1412	She's the only woman to ever do the catch a bullet trick.	57
1413	Shouldn't we be trying to maximize what we can save here?	57
1414	I just know that I can't live my life feeling like we do.	57
1415	Have you gotten any strange letters or packages recently?	57
1416	Have you sent the committee a character reference for me?	57
1417	Glad to see taking a year off didn't dull your skill set.	57
1418	But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.	57
1419	But some are physiological, and others are psychological.	57
1420	'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.	57
1421	certain carpet-cleaning chemicals have been linked to it.	57
1422	Cultures take time, and his liver doesn't have much left.	57
1423	Do you have any medical justification for your diagnosis?	57
1424	Do you mind unbuttoning your shirt and lying down for me?	57
1425	And I will pay you not to go to anger management classes.	57
1426	Almost anything works after boxing, except the word game.	57
1427	Ah, shut it off! Apparently we're allowed to do this now.	57
1428	Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.	57
1429	Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch.	57
1430	We can do a partial liver transplant from a living donor.	57
1431	Which you're gonna use to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.	57
1432	That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.	57
1433	Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.	57
1434	There wasn't any money missing from the scholarship fund.	57
1435	They did a bunch of vaccinations, including pneumococcus.	57
1436	Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?	57
1437	Your son Ben is in the hospital, at Princeton-Plainsboro.	57
1438	You can't go to their house without Foreman's permission.	57
1439	You do know I punched the last person that pissed me off?	57
1440	You have to give him something he values more than honor.	57
1441	You think it's the end of the world, but you wanted kids.	57
1442	You were ready to do one, as long as you were supervised.	57
1443	Is there some problem with the prescription you gave me?	56
1444	It definitely started with the great mastectomy of 2001.	56
1445	Just thought you might need someone to talk to about it.	56
1446	It was a controlled reaction that went a little haywire.	56
1447	If you don't mind me asking, why are you becoming a nun?	56
1448	If you keep being stubborn, he will keep being stubborn.	56
1449	If you want my money, I'll need to see a five-year plan.	56
1450	If our donor had an allergy, it could explain the lungs.	56
1451	I thought the patient had normal pressure hydrocephalus.	56
1452	Now that they're being filtered out, the blood would be.	56
1453	Or it's your family, some kind of immigrant pride thing.	56
1454	No, there's not even a bottle of wite-out in this place.	56
1455	Most jobs require at least basic word processing skills.	56
1456	Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.	56
1457	I just haven't found a way to make them interesting yet.	56
1458	I just want to do everything I can to protect my family.	56
1459	I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.	56
1460	I miss my wife, but it's not driving my decision-making.	56
1461	House left a bottle of Vicodin to see if she'd steal it.	56
1462	Hands behind your head! On the ground! You are so lucky.	56
1463	He isn't gonna put himself back in jail over a dead kid.	56
1464	Girl who doesn't want anything from a stranger is crazy.	56
1465	"Good things usually happen; bad things sometimes happen."	56
1466	He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.	56
1467	But now that I accept that, I feel much less conflicted.	56
1468	But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.	56
1469	Chips! You should have seen her face when mom walked in.	56
1470	Clever tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.	56
1471	buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.	56
1472	An entire hospital betting on the legitimacy of my kids?	56
1473	And MS and vasculitis usually get better with pregnancy.	56
1474	And somehow, you managed to con her into hanging around.	56
1475	And that probably leaves you as former Dean of Medicine.	56
1476	And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea.	56
1477	And when you do, I'm gonna take you to puerto escondido.	56
1478	We wait 30 minutes, she'll definitely have brain damage.	56
1479	Why don't you show Joseph where the visitor's lounge is?	56
1480	Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony.	56
1481	Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.	56
1482	Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right.	56
1483	That's why I would like her sister to live near my home.	56
1484	The confederates be giving themselves spankin' new tats.	56
1485	there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round You're fired.	56
1486	To do that, I need to know what he's doing and planning.	56
1487	they actually have two completely different derivations.	56
1488	They had on on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off.	56
1489	You've had your hair cut three times since I've met you.	56
1490	You--you meddle and force me into impossible situations.	56
1491	You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.	56
1492	You're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.	56
1493	Your arthritis is obviously-- I can pick up my own lawn.	56
1494	Your drinking wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.	56
1495	Your occipital lobe is acting up, giving you a migraine.	56
1496	Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.	56
1497	You were expecting to bore us for at least half an hour.	56
1498	It's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.	55
1499	It's just me telling him he can get away with anything.	55
1500	I'm Walter Cofield, Chief of Neurology, Mercy Hospital.	55
1501	Is another one hooking up with 38-year-old married men?	55
1502	It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.	55
1503	Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw.	55
1504	It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.	55
1505	I was at my lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.	55
1506	If he thinks this is the only way to help your patient.	55
1507	If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.	55
1508	If one of them's a match, that'd speed things up a lot.	55
1509	I think it should give you solace, help you to move on.	55
1510	I thought threatening him with jail would be different.	55
1511	I understand that we're in a hurry but maybe he should.	55
1512	Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.	55
1513	Now, if I punched him in the face, that he could prove.	55
1514	Or he's doing an amazing thing for another human being.	55
1515	Or it's been chronic, which points to GAD autoimmunity.	55
1516	Otherwise, we might not be able to find a marrow match.	55
1517	Pffftt! Then I will come in dead of night Working late?	55
1518	My life at home sucked, so I got the hell out of there.	55
1519	Means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.	55
1520	So what do you think-- is the patient paranoid or am I?	55
1521	'Round-the-clock or not, parenting's an impossible job.	55
1522	Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL levels rise.	55
1523	Probably spent more time with him than his own parents.	55
1524	Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.	55
1525	I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago.	55
1526	I don't want to be lied to, and I can't live like that.	55
1527	I need to feel like he loves me more than other people.	55
1528	I can't go back there! You may have a fungal infection.	55
1529	Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition.	55
1530	Fresh from the word I need you to drive me to a doctor.	55
1531	He has a lot more to lose than I do, and he knows that.	55
1532	He's also slept with her far fewer times than you have.	55
1533	But anything you can remember might help save his life.	55
1534	But if it's completely clotted, it may indicate cancer.	55
1535	Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.	55
1536	Do you know any of the kids at the party with your son?	55
1537	Doesn't sound like the outside world got much of a try.	55
1538	And the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.	55
1539	As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.	55
1540	Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.	55
1541	Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.	55
1542	What exactly were you doing when you had your reaction?	55
1543	Which also happens to be what the mom wants to believe.	55
1544	Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.	55
1545	The condition being that you're employed by me at PPTH.	55
1546	The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.	55
1547	The good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.	55
1548	The guy has earned the right to go to one boxing match.	55
1549	There are hundreds of people who would do that for you.	55
1550	There wasn't any abnormal electrical activity in his E.	55
1551	Thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.	55
1552	This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.	55
1553	You--you hope you're wrong for the sake of the patient?	55
1554	Yeah, how did-- I found out where your boyfriend lives.	55
1555	You couldn't round up enough doddering old Guinea pigs.	55
1556	You ever see me chatting on the phone, taking visitors?	55
1557	You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair.	55
1558	You know, I just got off the phone with some investors.	55
1559	Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.	54
1560	Looks like you're gonna need a bigger rationalization.	54
1561	More clever and you'll always be one step ahead of me.	54
1562	Joint pain, osteopenia, and anaphylaxis, eyebrow loss.	54
1563	It proved the patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.	54
1564	It sounds like there could be spinal cord involvement.	54
1565	If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero.	54
1566	If they found out what I've done, they'd be mortified.	54
1567	If you only heard claudication and carotid dissection.	54
1568	I'd like to ask you about your grandson, Drew Lemaine.	54
1569	If it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have to repair it.	54
1570	If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured.	54
1571	I think your symptoms are the result of alcohol abuse.	54
1572	I want to make sure I can position her wrist properly.	54
1573	Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back.	54
1574	Mr.Chips's owner only feeds him on apples and bananas.	54
1575	Next time, you could probably drop the undercover act.	54
1576	No, the part where he said that baby doesn't need you.	54
1577	So if I give you $200,000, I'll feel smart and pretty.	54
1578	Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting.	54
1579	Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.	54
1580	Paraneoplastic reaction caused the breathing problems.	54
1581	Pull! Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action.	54
1582	She got sick in the middle of her 14th birthday party.	54
1583	She is there for him in the only way that matters now.	54
1584	I hitchhiked to Manhattan, moved in with an older guy.	54
1585	How else do I compare them to other genetic disorders?	54
1586	His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.	54
1587	I don't know the history, but everyone makes mistakes.	54
1588	Even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.	54
1589	fake an interest in them because you needed to, right?	54
1590	He ate a bag of peanuts, and peanut proteins would be.	54
1591	He said he understood completely and that I was fired.	54
1592	He's young, and he was perfectly healthy two days ago.	54
1593	Hey! I thought you weren't getting back till tomorrow.	54
1594	But it's a perfect time if you're a member of my team.	54
1595	But you were actually a friend to me when I needed it.	54
1596	'Cause your micromanaging kept us from doing a biopsy.	54
1597	C.T. his liver, find the damaged area, and cut it out.	54
1598	Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.	54
1599	Could we go back on the record and get this over with?	54
1600	Construction company in Japan founded in the year 578.	54
1601	Different alters can have different apparent symptoms.	54
1602	Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?	54
1603	And I want to let you know wanted to see how you were.	54
1604	And that's just some of the lies from the last minute.	54
1605	Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories.	54
1606	Blackbird has spoken like the first bird What's wrong?	54
1607	Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?	54
1608	Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.	54
1609	Weaving through the cracks we are simply human Whoops.	54
1610	The good news is, made me realize that you were right.	54
1611	The only evidence you have is proof of something else.	54
1612	There are other options besides living on the streets.	54
1613	That's because he is actually trying to get you fired.	54
1614	Tularemia doesn't always show up in blood work either.	54
1615	You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.	54
1616	You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew.	54
1617	You said you weren't gonna overrule me diagnostically.	54
1618	I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh?	53
1619	Lowering his libido and causing erectile dysfunction.	53
1620	More likely the patient has a hyperammonemic problem.	53
1621	Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.	53
1622	IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies, he'll be fine.	53
1623	Joked about what a crappy deal you got for Manhattan?	53
1624	It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it.	53
1625	If there's a little blood bubbling up, that's normal.	53
1626	If this is really about family, you will not do this.	53
1627	If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.	53
1628	I take it felonies aren't a violation of your parole?	53
1629	I want to pay attention to them, but they're just so.	53
1630	One day I was in the park talking with another nanny.	53
1631	No one joins the clergy without having that epiphany.	53
1632	No, I'm not agreeing to anything until I talk to her.	53
1633	Ms. I gather from the silence that Chase isn't there.	53
1634	Stop telling the nurses I'm looking for a girlfriend.	53
1635	Right, better my mom should use me as a punching bag.	53
1636	Plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you.	53
1637	She knew better than anybody what a tool he could be.	53
1638	Shouldn't I use that money to do something important?	53
1639	I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.	53
1640	I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.	53
1641	I know you didn't feel anything when you almost died.	53
1642	I need to prove I have the confidence to disobey him.	53
1643	How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the man.	53
1644	I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go.	53
1645	I already told Foreman he'd been drinking that night.	53
1646	Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.	53
1647	From here who can we trust I wonder what happens now.	53
1648	He barely said a couple of words and set the boy off.	53
1649	Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage.	53
1650	Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving, but not this fast.	53
1651	But just do whatever you have to do to get over this.	53
1652	Can even cause some unpredictable allergic reactions.	53
1653	By definition, no class can teach you to expect them.	53
1654	Don't worry, I know you're not the relationship type.	53
1655	Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.	53
1656	Devils' starting goalie for, like, the past 20 years.	53
1657	Donor's an 18-year-old college kid back from Hosftra.	53
1658	And old team for the win! Not that I'm keeping score.	53
1659	A hidden bunker with enough guns to defend Fort Knox.	53
1660	A little less duck sauce and a little more soy sauce.	53
1661	All you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.	53
1662	Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and, yes, mental changes.	53
1663	And there's no way I'm leaving him here unsupervised.	53
1664	Believe me, I'd rather be the guy with the clipboard.	53
1665	Because, because I'll meet you at your place at 8:00.	53
1666	Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA.	53
1667	We've got to get you back to the hospital right away.	53
1668	Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict.	53
1669	We need to get him to the point he was at last night.	53
1670	We need to lavage before she drowns in her own blood.	53
1671	We share a traveling X-ray machine two other clinics.	53
1672	We think that's why you passed out and couldn't move.	53
1673	What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you.	53
1674	The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.	53
1675	The echo will show us any growths on his heart valve.	53
1676	The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.	53
1677	That was so I could ask about the second possibility.	53
1678	To a guy who loves penis enough for the both of them.	53
1679	two sentences in, and you're already making promises.	53
1680	They can be pretty hard to detect in people under 50.	53
1681	This is what she was opening when she had her attack.	53
1682	This woman's life is probably better off without sex.	53
1683	You're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.	53
1684	Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances.	53
1685	You don't think defying human nature is neurological?	53
1686	You know what else doesn't show up in the blood work?	53
1687	You shouldn't run from what can still be a good life.	53
1688	You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?	53
1689	You thought it was insane, and yet you let it happen.	53
1690	It's a very expensive machine, and I'd like it back.	52
1691	It's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.	52
1692	It's got to be a clot keeping her from bleeding out.	52
1693	In fact, he actually called you Stompee, with an ee.	52
1694	Morning! I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.	52
1695	If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove?	52
1696	If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here.	52
1697	If he has myelodysplastic syndrome, he'll bleed out.	52
1698	I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.	52
1699	I thought you were gonna go to bed early last night.	52
1700	I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.	52
1701	I will see you this weekend when you pick up Sophie.	52
1702	Oh, yes, they do! They're gonna find out eventually.	52
1703	Okay, he comes, he thinks he's waiting for practice.	52
1704	Now she can't--there's no reason for us not to call.	52
1705	Patient complained of a sore throat a few weeks ago.	52
1706	Places where they send you You're trying to save me.	52
1707	My parents had $800 between them when they got here.	52
1708	So do I wish mom had used a gun instead of a bottle?	52
1709	So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?	52
1710	Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her.	52
1711	Systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.	52
1712	She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her.	52
1713	She's throwing away her life because of blind faith.	52
1714	I just mean the part about the odds of it happening.	52
1715	I know when House went to prison, you quit medicine.	52
1716	House has to believe that I have authority over him.	52
1717	I can think of easier ways to make 175 bucks a week.	52
1718	I can't discuss any of that, not before the hearing.	52
1719	Got a policy review meeting in here in five minutes.	52
1720	I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.	52
1721	Especially in a house with locked medicine cabinets.	52
1722	Had a meeting about a new parking validation system.	52
1723	He didn't understand and he didn't seem traumatized.	52
1724	He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis.	52
1725	He needs to constantly establish he's the Alpha dog.	52
1726	But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to.	52
1727	'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something.	52
1728	Big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung.	52
1729	Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida?	52
1730	And then go back to sneaking around behind his back?	52
1731	All right, we need you to sit back and try to relax.	52
1732	Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr.	52
1733	At least I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.	52
1734	Anyway, he'd be getting better right now, not worse.	52
1735	Apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night.	52
1736	Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy.	52
1737	We need you to sit, focus, and answer our questions.	52
1738	We would have seen evidence of brugada in the E.K.G.	52
1739	What would House want with a skin resurfacing laser?	52
1740	The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass.	52
1741	There's plenty of time for that after the operation.	52
1742	This is a C.T. scan of his liver from ten hours ago.	52
1743	You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.	52
1744	You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney.	52
1745	Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me.	52
1746	You'll appreciate that I left the idiots subtextual.	52
1747	Working on a medical case is not a parole violation.	52
1748	Yeah, but you're hot, so it's easier to put up with.	52
1749	You implied that all would have been fine otherwise.	52
1750	You may not be aware of half the things you've done.	52
1751	You may remember me from the time I saved your life.	52
1752	You only have Park because she's on neurology's tab.	52
1753	It explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.	51
1754	Is it okay for me to walk away from that because I.	51
1755	Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to achieve.	51
1756	Maybe the problem isn't a heavy metal from outside.	51
1757	Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.	51
1758	I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's.	51
1759	It stands to reason that your emotions factored in.	51
1760	I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.	51
1761	I, uh, have this terrible pain in my left shoulder.	51
1762	So why didn't you want to go with her this morning?	51
1763	So I had to convince you that I'd given up looking.	51
1764	So they thought the patient would be better by now.	51
1765	Saline's flushing it forward but getting no return.	51
1766	see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.	51
1767	Plus Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, that's 11 in all.	51
1768	I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you.	51
1769	I guess, I mean-- yes, technically, I was thinking.	51
1770	I don't think he's moving the company out of greed.	51
1771	I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.	51
1772	I know this is hard, and I'm sorry about your wife.	51
1773	I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers.	51
1774	I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here.	51
1775	Eventually, you'll pass boredom and get to bonding.	51
1776	Guess what kind of animal Wacky Benny's making now?	51
1777	Burned his lungs, which is why he coughed up blood.	51
1778	But Chang and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam.	51
1779	But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.	51
1780	Don't usually see Darwinian changes over breakfast.	51
1781	Could be transient nitrogen load from a G.I. bleed.	51
1782	Could explain why his symptoms appeared so rapidly.	51
1783	Could you write me a fake prescription for Insulin?	51
1784	Considering I don't work here, arguably, I'm early.	51
1785	Dead patients usually get a lower standard of care.	51
1786	And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.	51
1787	And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.	51
1788	And no one in town is ever gonna speak to me again.	51
1789	Actually, the difference is pretty much $1 million.	51
1790	ARDS secondary to trauma is our leading hypothesis.	51
1791	We've run every test and ruled out all the options.	51
1792	Well, now that we've got that completely behind us.	51
1793	Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.	51
1794	We just need to know if-- - No, I already told you.	51
1795	What do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?	51
1796	Wait, I thought-- I thought you said it was stable.	51
1797	When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?	51
1798	the area moderating impulse control and compulsion.	51
1799	The E.E.G. didn't show any abnormal brain activity.	51
1800	The gun slipped and-- I only had blanks in it, but.	51
1801	The symptoms can take up to three days to manifest.	51
1802	There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.	51
1803	Totally offsets the stench of suffereing and death.	51
1804	Thanks, but I got a lot of work I need to get done.	51
1805	Think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there.	51
1806	This is coming from a man whose eyes are wide open.	51
1807	Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you.	51
1808	You're gonna get away from him by turning into him?	51
1809	You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.	51
1810	Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.	51
1811	Yeah, but even a broken doctor's right twice a day.	51
1812	You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?	51
1813	You have any idea how that last CEO must have felt?	51
1814	You realize you're making House's argument for him.	51
1815	You torched, nuked, and salted the earth with them.	51
1816	It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.	50
1817	Implicitly, you just said that Chase was at fault.	50
1818	It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.	50
1819	Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs.	50
1820	Make me lose my job by showing you a patient file?	50
1821	Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl.	50
1822	Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities.	50
1823	Just tell him about your parents or make up a lie.	50
1824	I've got an internship that starts in three weeks.	50
1825	It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.	50
1826	It was just paranoid rage, typical of Alzheimer's.	50
1827	I'll be doing what you would have done a year ago.	50
1828	I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was.	50
1829	I'm running a special on grilled cheese this week.	50
1830	Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option.	50
1831	I think we should talk about Lena's grandchildren.	50
1832	I told House I couldn't come back until next week.	50
1833	Or the mom agrees to an autopsy so I can prove it.	50
1834	Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life.	50
1835	No pesticides, fertilizers, or fuel in the garage.	50
1836	No, he hasn't had anxiety or any trouble sleeping.	50
1837	My friend is here because you didn't listen to me.	50
1838	Neither of us is ready to give up on the marriage.	50
1839	Schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.	50
1840	Surprised you didn't go into the diplomatic corps.	50
1841	Resume the antiemetics, and increase the sedation.	50
1842	Praise for the singing praise for the morning Dad?	50
1843	Priests and nuns were the closest I had to family.	50
1844	I hope this isn't going where I assume it's going.	50
1845	I had to drop my kids off at day care across town.	50
1846	I eat a lot of cheetos, I forget to wash my hands.	50
1847	I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.	50
1848	I knew you were very busy being vaguely important.	50
1849	I need an intubation kit in here! What's going on?	50
1850	His echocardiogram is negative for cardiomyopathy.	50
1851	Everyone had already refused to work on that case.	50
1852	Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.	50
1853	For every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.	50
1854	Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?	50
1855	He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer.	50
1856	Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein.	50
1857	Given his abnormal mental status, not necessarily.	50
1858	He's never hit her before or lost all his English.	50
1859	But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.	50
1860	Can't hurt to biopsy the rash while we're waiting.	50
1861	Chicago has a great program, and you're a dumbass.	50
1862	Could the bruising be caused by a physical trauma?	50
1863	Couldn't have caught a virus while he was outside.	50
1864	Day care costs more than what I earned as a nurse.	50
1865	And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.	50
1866	And that's what you took away from this situation?	50
1867	And that's why men always marry their right hands.	50
1868	Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.	50
1869	We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe.	50
1870	Well, if you change your mind, we'll be at Rudy's.	50
1871	Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz.	50
1872	We don't even know if they were sleeping together.	50
1873	We have time for one more test before we move him.	50
1874	We think we've dealt wit all the liability issues.	50
1875	Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?	50
1876	When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just.	50
1877	When's the last time you had a full night's sleep?	50
1878	The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting.	50
1879	The tumor interferes with certain natural systems.	50
1880	Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy.	50
1881	This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter y.	50
1882	This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?	50
1883	This is the only way you're gonna get your answer.	50
1884	Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.	50
1885	You're really not good at reading people, are you?	50
1886	Would you please read the caption under the photo?	50
1887	You came to the hospital with beer in your pocket.	50
1888	You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.	50
1889	You do understand the meaning of the word confirm.	50
1890	You still never told me why you left the seminary.	50
1891	You think it's possible he knew what he was doing?	50
1892	You think my judgment's the least bit compromised?	50
1893	Maybe we should just concentrate on the medicine.	49
1894	Maybe we should leave before the police get here.	49
1895	More than that, because you don't have an answer.	49
1896	It lowers libido and causes erectile dysfunction.	49
1897	It was a long time ago, but still you're curious.	49
1898	I'm gonna get better at it, and it's not a hobby.	49
1899	If we keep her off, she'll be moody, but healthy.	49
1900	If I have to plough that furrow myself, so be it.	49
1901	I shudder to think what that world would be like.	49
1902	My guilt over my mom is why I put up with my dad.	49
1903	My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes.	49
1904	Might be, if these were actually cheetos' stains.	49
1905	Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.	49
1906	Our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem.	49
1907	Outside of work, I still consider us all friends.	49
1908	She couldn't handle the thought of being on meds.	49
1909	She only had minor injuries, but her father died.	49
1910	She's not long term because she has no long term.	49
1911	I haven't done a jugular line since my residency.	49
1912	I had the nails and eyebrows done, but that's it.	49
1913	I only noticed because Chase was staring at them.	49
1914	How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?	49
1915	How can I be pregnant if I've never even had sex?	49
1916	Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?	49
1917	House not attach importance to patient histories?	49
1918	I asked him to meet me here for a family reunion.	49
1919	I actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes .	49
1920	I didn't want you to think you needed medication.	49
1921	Foreman, would you please reach under your chair?	49
1922	He used to wear those stupid things all the time.	49
1923	He's got a point, but I'll let you make the call.	49
1924	But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee.	49
1925	Clinical signs can show up days before lab signs.	49
1926	Buys 24 hours to fix it, 12 of which have passed.	49
1927	Dr.Neusinger canceled on them at the last minute.	49
1928	Dr.Park, would you please reach under that chair?	49
1929	Could the corticosteroids have somehow caused it?	49
1930	And now that she's a teenager, it's gotten worse.	49
1931	At least tell me you haven't been drinking today.	49
1932	And you're sure he didn't leave until after 9:00?	49
1933	Because I didn'tive him time to do anything else.	49
1934	Because it's so strong even plain contradictions.	49
1935	Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr.	49
1936	Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night.	49
1937	Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.	49
1938	We swore that we would see the elephant together.	49
1939	We'll start the steroids and see if it clears up.	49
1940	Well, he was all, you know, I could take Stomper.	49
1941	Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work.	49
1942	What, getting knifed doesn't buy me an extension?	49
1943	Why is he so obsessed with my kids being my kids?	49
1944	Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.	49
1945	That's why you cried out when House shot at Taub.	49
1946	The dining room's on the other side of that wall.	49
1947	The question is, what explains the liver failure?	49
1948	The whole town knows that you're in the hospital.	49
1949	Then he's allergic to something not on the tests.	49
1950	Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.	49
1951	That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking.	49
1952	To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?	49
1953	Together with the lung, it added up to Wegener's.	49
1954	They only come out when you're afraid or anxious.	49
1955	They said you were almost killed three weeks ago.	49
1956	Think you're up for answering a couple questions?	49
1957	You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?	49
1958	You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?	49
1959	Yes, please come back, and we'll get you started.	49
1960	Your patients love you because you're empathetic.	49
1961	You're about to withdraw from the world for good.	49
1962	You could still pass the gene onto your children.	49
1963	You do have a classified ad and a piece of metal.	49
1964	You missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors.	49
1965	You probably wouldn't want to have sex with them.	49
1966	You reassess your life when you've made mistakes.	49
1967	Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?	48
1968	Magazines go away so I won't ignore my children.	48
1969	Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.	48
1970	Just tell me what's safe to inject in his thigh.	48
1971	It's the most famous conjoined twins in history.	48
1972	Just hiding out till House leaves the cafeteria.	48
1973	It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.	48
1974	I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning.	48
1975	I'm growing more and more curious by the moment.	48
1976	If the kid had a rash or some circulation issue.	48
1977	If you need help, you can take whoever you want.	48
1978	I told him because it was the right thing to do.	48
1979	Oh, it feels like you stuck me with a hot poker.	48
1980	Patient had an idiopathic anaphylactic reaction.	48
1981	My team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.	48
1982	Nothing wrong except a common bladder infection.	48
1983	Never said anything about the patient's husband.	48
1984	So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?	48
1985	So I found a way to let you know to not be late.	48
1986	S08E05 The Confession By Mikhel for: Subtitulos.	48
1987	Save people's lives instead of just their noses?	48
1988	Reilly's done far fewer dissections than I have.	48
1989	Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.	48
1990	Telling the truth may have just killed this guy.	48
1991	Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.	48
1992	Remember that guy from the restaurant yesterday?	48
1993	She could have listened to me about my drinking.	48
1994	She gave her notice the day after your incident.	48
1995	I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr.	48
1996	I knew that she was the woman I wanted to marry.	48
1997	I needed the cash, and, um, the locker was open.	48
1998	How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?	48
1999	Hope you practiced the immaculate contraception.	48
2000	I couldn't tell you how many times she nearly O.	48
2001	Everyone back at school is so worried about you.	48
2002	Except for the annoying guilt about the husband.	48
2003	Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.	48
2004	He can't say my kids until he lets me test them.	48
2005	Head CT showed no signs of stroke or hemorrhage.	48
2006	But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it.	48
2007	Cocaine abuse can cause paranoia and chest pain.	48
2008	Can you-- - I don't know how to use the program.	48
2009	ed and I had to clean her up and put her in bed.	48
2010	Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now.	48
2011	Dead kid's house was on the way to my apartment.	48
2012	Do you have any questions before we get started?	48
2013	And any minor infection could have caused those.	48
2014	And don't even pretend like you're not relieved.	48
2015	And get the real story on clown, senior's death.	48
2016	And I knew that meant making certain sacrifices.	48
2017	And she was nagging you about finding a husband.	48
2018	A year after that, he started forgetting things.	48
2019	After having been rejected explains the clothes.	48
2020	Assuming, of course, we are talking about House.	48
2021	And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun.	48
2022	Because people never lie about people they hate.	48
2023	Although I'm curious about a general answer too.	48
2024	Wait, why would you think his wife poisoned him?	48
2025	What if she didn't get this from being homeless?	48
2026	Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?	48
2027	Where are we going now I'm not going to Chicago.	48
2028	Which is why you're not gonna live there either.	48
2029	The stress! And I get the runs almost every day.	48
2030	There is a way that you can get your money back.	48
2031	Two rounds of 360 without establishing a rhythm.	48
2032	You can go to hell! Why don't you kill yourself?	48
2033	You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning.	48
2034	You give away millions and you don't own a suit?	48
2035	You really got a thing for swastikas, Mendelson.	48
2036	You two really need to do your homework with me.	48
2037	The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.	47
2038	It's better to think the man's dead but decent.	47
2039	It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.	47
2040	I'm sure it would mean a lot to him to see you.	47
2041	I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.	47
2042	Losing a child-- just breezed right through it.	47
2043	Just some irritation from lying in bed all day.	47
2044	Just wanted to make sure all three were inside.	47
2045	It's the silence, the contemplation, the order.	47
2046	I was happy watching the fight on pay-per-view.	47
2047	I'm a neurologist over at-- I know who you are.	47
2048	I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.	47
2049	If you need to talk to someone, a professional.	47
2050	If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care.	47
2051	I think that little of you and that much of me.	47
2052	I won this off her prop master in a poker game.	47
2053	Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once.	47
2054	Now the sex is both commitment- and guilt-free.	47
2055	Or it's GAD, and we started treatment too late.	47
2056	No muscle symptoms, and urine had no myoglobin.	47
2057	No, I'm just going through a bit of withdrawal.	47
2058	Nothing out of the ordinary at work or at home.	47
2059	None of his samples test positive for anything.	47
2060	Neither have you-- Analyze it however you like.	47
2061	Most people find it easier to ignore the truth.	47
2062	So you want twice as many of them disrespected?	47
2063	Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.	47
2064	Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.	47
2065	Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?	47
2066	Pressors will only give us a couple hours, Max.	47
2067	she lost the use of her arms and her innocence.	47
2068	She's tired of living on the streets after all.	47
2069	I had a video interview with Chicago yesterday.	47
2070	I have no idea what that second one stands for.	47
2071	I got it from the health fair I was working at.	47
2072	I don't wanna start any rumors, but-- But what?	47
2073	I don't want to validate his ridiculous theory.	47
2074	I just--I just got jostled a little, that's it.	47
2075	His trachea's blocked below the incision point.	47
2076	His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.	47
2077	Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us.	47
2078	House! Mendelson! He's on 80 mg of Propranolol.	47
2079	I don't have time to teach you to act like one.	47
2080	I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.	47
2081	I did pay for the room for the whole week, but.	47
2082	Excess adrenaline can cause heart problems and.	47
2083	Excuse me, but only family members are allowed.	47
2084	Dr.Adams, would you please reach into my pants?	47
2085	He'll probably die of boredom long before that.	47
2086	Her home number is-- Normal complement studies.	47
2087	He's watching tv d drinking martinis all night.	47
2088	He's giving a kidney to someone he's never met?	47
2089	He's having trouble holding a pencil in school.	47
2090	Early may is when the surf really picks up but.	47
2091	Dr.Foreman and I did not always see eye-to-eye.	47
2092	Cuddy had a problem with House, she came to me.	47
2093	Didn't you marry someone you used to work with?	47
2094	Disseminated viral infection with encephalitis.	47
2095	And I look forward to working with you as well.	47
2096	100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.	47
2097	All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out.	47
2098	At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily.	47
2099	And you never would have operated on her after.	47
2100	Bob, one of my shoes is missing from my locker.	47
2101	Because, eventually, he'll ask you to cross it.	47
2102	Are you going to have me fired for bad manners?	47
2103	Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group?	47
2104	We got about five minutes till pinto gets back.	47
2105	Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun.	47
2106	Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker.	47
2107	That's why House used the hurt boyfriend story.	47
2108	The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.	47
2109	Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.	47
2110	These are supposed to be in the computer files.	47
2111	This is how you plan to get to the boxing game?	47
2112	Yes, it was nice having my daughter in my home.	47
2113	You'll be here six more months, minimum! Sorry.	47
2114	Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.	47
2115	Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.	47
2116	Yeah, I was saying I agreed with the other one.	47
2117	You know that everyone on that panel hates you.	47
2118	Infected blood and tissue everywhere you look.	46
2119	Is this theory more promising than the others?	46
2120	I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense right now.	46
2121	Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way.	46
2122	Maybe you could tell your husband that we did.	46
2123	Let's just hope no one cut the wrong wire, eh?	46
2124	It's a family heirloom, which means old money.	46
2125	If it's a disease, then he's six inches under.	46
2126	If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.	46
2127	Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring.	46
2128	Now shut up and let's see if he has an attack.	46
2129	Now, how could I have gotten my hands on that?	46
2130	Ooh, I mean, that's pricy, but it can be done.	46
2131	Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation.	46
2132	No sign of a pneumothorax or deep sulcus sign.	46
2133	Might be easier if you'd stay out of the room.	46
2134	Syphilitic vasculitis would explain the T.I.A.	46
2135	Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?	46
2136	Reverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago.	46
2137	She asked me to appear on the medical segment.	46
2138	She was the girlfriend of a loser drug dealer.	46
2139	Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago.	46
2140	She's the same person who won't take my calls.	46
2141	I haven't heard the name Bobby in a long time.	46
2142	I just needed to create a distraction, though.	46
2143	I don't think we actually have much of a case.	46
2144	I didn't say which side of the door he was on.	46
2145	I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.	46
2146	I should be back on the road in a few minutes.	46
2147	I mean, I hope to God I never have to use one.	46
2148	Hold the analysis and help me save this thing.	46
2149	House S08E06 Parents By Mikhel for Subtitulos.	46
2150	Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.	46
2151	He can fight this off if we give him a chance.	46
2152	He wouldn't even ce to the door a second time.	46
2153	Here's a photograph of me holding a newspaper.	46
2154	But he's really excited about representing me.	46
2155	But what about compromising it in a minor way?	46
2156	But you found a tear just below the esophagus.	46
2157	'Cause my boss says he doesn't have the money.	46
2158	Causes arrhythmia, tremor, and mental changes.	46
2159	Complete recruitment and interference pattern.	46
2160	And during about nine years of previous cases.	46
2161	And if you do it long enough, it becomes real?	46
2162	And now there's still something wrong with me.	46
2163	Again, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's.	46
2164	At this point, being he makes you feel better.	46
2165	And, for the first time, she's acting like it.	46
2166	Answer the question before answering the door.	46
2167	Well, it's not like I can get up and run away.	46
2168	We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound.	46
2169	We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding.	46
2170	What does it matter if she says she's asexual?	46
2171	What's somewhere he could see the kids arrive?	46
2172	Why was it not already in the patient history?	46
2173	Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?	46
2174	Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?	46
2175	Which means it's too late for me to back down.	46
2176	Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie.	46
2177	The health fair is one of my responsibilities.	46
2178	The hypothermia could've caused cell necrosis.	46
2179	The lungs will never be viable for transplant.	46
2180	The point is, I gave it to you, so we're even.	46
2181	The rivets go pop, I slide in the heating pad.	46
2182	The word transient is right there in the name.	46
2183	Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine.	46
2184	There's plenty of kids who hate their parents.	46
2185	There's some sweats in the closet in the back.	46
2186	These personalities that I'm supposed to have.	46
2187	This whole thing was about your ankle monitor.	46
2188	You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first.	46
2189	Will anyone believe Chase is an actual Doctor?	46
2190	You'd rather have House fire you than Foreman?	46
2191	You don't actually think this is neurological.	46
2192	You said you didn't anticipate their defiance.	46
2193	It's less dangerous than where you're headed.	45
2194	It's not my problem if you go back to prison.	45
2195	Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?	45
2196	Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?	45
2197	Look what happened with London and the riots.	45
2198	Married one's not a keeper, but it's a start.	45
2199	It's temperature that sets it off, not force.	45
2200	Just because that's what you'd miss the most.	45
2201	It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.	45
2202	I'm defending the dad because he got screwed.	45
2203	I'm a talented physician, top 2% of my class.	45
2204	I'm actually thinking of just getting my ged.	45
2205	I'm in a dump with a guy almost twice my age.	45
2206	If the plumbing's fine, check the electrical.	45
2207	I take it it's not at a place with a big top.	45
2208	Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.	45
2209	Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?	45
2210	Or something you wear, own, use, or gave him.	45
2211	People with mental deficiency can be logical.	45
2212	No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins.	45
2213	Must be such a pleasure to live in your head.	45
2214	No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear.	45
2215	No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast.	45
2216	So you're just gonna let me walk out of here.	45
2217	Said to tell you he's no longer your patient.	45
2218	Screen tested it yesterday and shot it today.	45
2219	Reasonable theory, supported by the evidence.	45
2220	Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.	45
2221	Something happened that you were upset about?	45
2222	Please, you have to help me solve this thing.	45
2223	Probably just a really, really decent person.	45
2224	Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.	45
2225	I had it put in during the remodel last year.	45
2226	I don't think Emory wants to share right now.	45
2227	I met a woman who likes her men well groomed.	45
2228	How do you expect to get into a good college?	45
2229	How long can I assume that he's been smoking?	45
2230	How could the rest of us possibly understand?	45
2231	I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.	45
2232	Explains the negatives of the blood disorder.	45
2233	He may just be shooting himself in the ankle.	45
2234	He yelled at you for letting me see the file?	45
2235	Her feelings are based on a chemical process.	45
2236	Good news is, it's treatable with medication.	45
2237	Building Buddhist temples for 50 generations.	45
2238	Burn cream would drown him faster than water.	45
2239	But the steroids would have treated for that.	45
2240	'Cause next, it'll be three cases, then four.	45
2241	Biopsy revealed, white blood cell inflitrate.	45
2242	Come on! Thanks for getting me to the clinic.	45
2243	Diabetic girlfriend without health insurance?	45
2244	Didn't peg you as the midday fun kind of guy.	45
2245	Do you know what sound people make about him?	45
2246	Doesn't replace two 'round-the-clock parents.	45
2247	Donor six traveled to Thailand around Khorat.	45
2248	45-year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures.	45
2249	A sign that you need to take a long vacation.	45
2250	Actually, it's something that comes up often.	45
2251	At least it wouldn't be so annoying to watch.	45
2252	And when I make more, I'll give that way too.	45
2253	Angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.	45
2254	Another dozen getting teargas hosed off them.	45
2255	We're still waiting for that jell-o delivery.	45
2256	We're treating you for an overactive thyroid.	45
2257	Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped.	45
2258	Well, why would anyone try to poison our guy?	45
2259	We should probably leave the body in the bag.	45
2260	What, so I can get busted by Social Services?	45
2261	When he encouraged Ben to drop out of school?	45
2262	Which brings me to my most relevant question.	45
2263	That's why all parents screw up all children.	45
2264	Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever.	45
2265	That explains everything but the lymph nodes.	45
2266	That soccer trophy you were telling me about.	45
2267	That's how daddy likes to spend his time too.	45
2268	Try not to kill anyone else until I get back.	45
2269	This all started when he cheated on his wife.	45
2270	This is a big one, and it's the premium slot.	45
2271	You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.	45
2272	You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.	45
2273	Would you--would you tell me what's going on?	45
2274	You can look at the patient file if you want.	45
2275	You could at least let her sleep in the room.	45
2276	You just need to answer a few more questions.	45
2277	You open the door I want to be understanding.	45
2278	You think that's gonna last through the ages?	45
2279	I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.	44
2280	It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus.	44
2281	In fact, I cheated most of you here tonight.	44
2282	Is my snacking really relevant to this case?	44
2283	Made in the People's Republic of lead paint.	44
2284	Kiddie-winkies! I wonder who they belong to.	44
2285	It's the mind's response to a severe trauma.	44
2286	I've seen how you disrespect those patients.	44
2287	It went to interior designers, I understand.	44
2288	I'm guessing he does things like that a lot.	44
2289	I'd prefer to be paid in a single $100 bill.	44
2290	I spoke to the head of neurology in Chicago.	44
2291	Oh, just how different the two cultures are.	44
2292	Other than the fact that my dad's in a coma.	44
2293	No one else wants to talk about the patient?	44
2294	My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.	44
2295	My ten-year-old cousin lives near Cebu City.	44
2296	Nice try, but I'm not getting in the middle.	44
2297	So he has two types of people inside of him.	44
2298	Said the divorced woman to the divorced man.	44
2299	Repeat this, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.	44
2300	Pregnancy would explain all of her symptoms.	44
2301	Pregnancy, vaginal bleeding, and elevated B.	44
2302	Probably started growing in his early teens.	44
2303	I hear one of you thinks I'm a real bastard.	44
2304	I just gotta do a standard battery of tests.	44
2305	I knew when he got out, I'd get my job back.	44
2306	House's process is dangerous, inappropriate.	44
2307	How did you find that without a stethoscope?	44
2308	I brought him in here under false pretenses.	44
2309	Especially since you're short a team member.	44
2310	Followed your advice and took the night off.	44
2311	For example, our opinions on mental illness.	44
2312	Guard! You're going into anaphylactic shock.	44
2313	Hasn't even broken as much as a traffic law.	44
2314	He has no heartbeat, and he's not breathing.	44
2315	Gallstones could've-- no complaints of pain.	44
2316	Hey, Emory, should we, uh, powder our noses?	44
2317	He's also dreamy, but it's not relevant now.	44
2318	But it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.	44
2319	But you already promised it to someone else.	44
2320	But you do know I just can't let this slide.	44
2321	Can you believe she used to work in the can?	44
2322	Could it be she doesn't know the difference?	44
2323	Did he meet your patient with renal failure?	44
2324	Did you learn anything at Jane Doe's school?	44
2325	And everyone else just went along with this?	44
2326	At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon.	44
2327	At least his white blood cells were special.	44
2328	At the time, it seemed-- - Oh, let me guess.	44
2329	Because you shouldn't be living on your own.	44
2330	Because you're not gonna be able to breathe.	44
2331	Are there any side effects to the treatment?	44
2332	Are you having trouble talking, like before?	44
2333	Also known as multiple personality disorder.	44
2334	Well, I'm glad we could be so accommodating.	44
2335	We just need to get a good look at the rash.	44
2336	We should find out if she's been vaccinated.	44
2337	We try to get you up to 50 words per minute.	44
2338	We won't have the results until the morning.	44
2339	Well, I know that Jesus walked on water but.	44
2340	What happened to the social worker I called?	44
2341	Why would you think you needed so many guns?	44
2342	Which, in turn, in turn, makes you so fired.	44
2343	The blast will fry what's left of his liver.	44
2344	The buildup of toxins is causing everything.	44
2345	Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks.	44
2346	That God's love is speaking to you directly.	44
2347	There's definitely something wrong with him.	44
2348	They're reacting to something in the plasma.	44
2349	This is just messing with my feng shui here.	44
2350	Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson.	44
2351	Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.	44
2352	You're a lot taller than I thought you'd be.	44
2353	You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?	44
2354	You don't think I should have gone with rat?	44
2355	You felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.	44
2356	You never told me what caused your accident.	44
2357	You really wanna turn your back on this guy?	44
2358	You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?	44
2359	Just knowing you're there for me is enough.	43
2360	It's just really hard doing this by myself.	43
2361	Is the problem hyperammonemic or synthetic?	43
2362	Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.	43
2363	Knowing you can send me right back to jail?	43
2364	Lungs, rash, now excessive R-R variability.	43
2365	More dangerous than complete renal failure?	43
2366	I've got only two years left in my stretch.	43
2367	It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.	43
2368	It means you don't have to make that drive.	43
2369	It was just your misinterpretation of them.	43
2370	I'll let you know when we have the results.	43
2371	I'll take the fallout from Social Services.	43
2372	I'm gonna drop our kids off at my mother's.	43
2373	If you want silence, you can get ear plugs.	43
2374	People donate shoes and suits all the time.	43
2375	No wonder you're playing handsies with her.	43
2376	My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.	43
2377	My team is made up of Type-A personalities.	43
2378	Means this donation was given under duress.	43
2379	Might actually contribute to that reaction.	43
2380	Not seeing an embryo in the fallopian tube.	43
2381	Next thing I knew, I was laying on my back.	43
2382	Tell the Dean that I don't want to see her.	43
2383	Sometimes, you just don't get the job, but.	43
2384	Right up until it made me lose my daughter.	43
2385	Plus, the kid's never been sexually active.	43
2386	Pujols called and said the patient ran off.	43
2387	She was in a car accident when she was two.	43
2388	I expect my people to lie better than that.	43
2389	I don't think the world's coming to an end.	43
2390	I need to be taken into protective custody.	43
2391	I need to talk to mommy alone for a second.	43
2392	House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass.	43
2393	I breathe it in my soul Is everything okay?	43
2394	Got a patient with end stage renal disease.	43
2395	Don't you guys think this is irresponsible?	43
2396	Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.	43
2397	Foreman warned us that you'd try something.	43
2398	Have you been having regular periods, Iris?	43
2399	He just opened his eyes a little while ago.	43
2400	He makes a living sending people to prison.	43
2401	He said-- no, I'm talking about the jell-o.	43
2402	But daddy's boss is what we call a jackass.	43
2403	But it ends, like, three feet further over.	43
2404	But this could also be pesticide poisoning.	43
2405	'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.	43
2406	Cauterized the ulcer, stopped the bleeding.	43
2407	Check his TSH levels and get a sleep study.	43
2408	Can you get me an escort to gather samples?	43
2409	Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.	43
2410	10 milligrams of Diazepam! - Already on it.	43
2411	According to my calendar, I'm a week early.	43
2412	And to wipe that out, you need special ops.	43
2413	And you said I wouldn't be able to help it.	43
2414	Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off.	43
2415	Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst.	43
2416	Well, think of this as today's free clinic.	43
2417	viral infection weakening the wall muscles.	43
2418	Upping the nitro should knock it back down.	43
2419	We needed to see if it was still a symptom.	43
2420	We should add language loss and aggression.	43
2421	We watched the Devils demolish the Rangers.	43
2422	Why would I be trying to make him look bad?	43
2423	Which means he's both irascible and stupid.	43
2424	The Board decided to dock me two weeks pay.	43
2425	The one asking me to bring you some dinner.	43
2426	That's a pretty nice trophy, there, Andres.	43
2427	That's 'cause he's retooled the ol' todger.	43
2428	Tommy's the most popular guy in his office.	43
2429	Treat the patient with activated protein c.	43
2430	Treat with Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid.	43
2431	Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.	43
2432	There's no living relatives that I know of.	43
2433	There's the two of you kissing over dinner.	43
2434	They never drop character while in uniform.	43
2435	They're gonna charge you with extra crimes.	43
2436	This proves nothing because it's not a gun.	43
2437	Those scars on my ass you may have noticed.	43
2438	Those who can move on, and those who can't.	43
2439	You're the reason I'm out of the big house.	43
2440	Your brain knew he's better off without it.	43
2441	With great power comes great micromanaging.	43
2442	Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.	43
2443	You don't think I can keep this up all day?	43
2444	You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?	43
2445	You have one patient and three DNA results?	43
2446	You mean like we should be more optimistic?	43
2447	You need to get cotton swabs-- but not now.	43
2448	It's been a family business for 120 years.	42
2449	It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.	42
2450	In addition to the multiple personalities?	42
2451	Is that your hand near her nether regions?	42
2452	Is, uh, is this because of the medication?	42
2453	Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?	42
2454	It's not the place to exorcise your guilt.	42
2455	Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.	42
2456	It's the fundamental drive of our species.	42
2457	I've been waiting my entire life for that.	42
2458	Joseph helps me with my husband sometimes.	42
2459	It was for our own good, but I don't care.	42
2460	I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.	42
2461	If you double his placebo, he might drown.	42
2462	If it makes you feel better to think that.	42
2463	I think they got the cause of death wrong.	42
2464	I think I'm gonna-- all right, I admit it.	42
2465	I thought the patient had a liver problem.	42
2466	I was a mess, and she just sat there like.	42
2467	I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.	42
2468	I would have donated the money to charity.	42
2469	Now it feels like my whole body's on fire.	42
2470	Now, that has baggage stamped all over it.	42
2471	Not with normal posterior column function.	42
2472	Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice.	42
2473	New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.	42
2474	Most medication exacerbates the condition.	42
2475	So why did chelation make the lungs worse?	42
2476	Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.	42
2477	Tell all the alters that they have cancer.	42
2478	Still there's only one way to settle this.	42
2479	Right upper quadrant, pain and distension.	42
2480	Pain would be restricted to one dermatome.	42
2481	She has to either dump him or forgive him.	42
2482	She wants nothing to do with Drew's death.	42
2483	She'd rather remember her like she is now.	42
2484	She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.	42
2485	I heard about a good new vegetarian place.	42
2486	I just don't want to indulge your-- Lupus.	42
2487	I have an occasional beer with my friends.	42
2488	I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.	42
2489	I like my job, and I'm happy with my life.	42
2490	His company's moving him back to Portland.	42
2491	House didn't even know he was coming back.	42
2492	I can barely look her in the eyes anymore.	42
2493	Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.	42
2494	First off, be a decent, empathetic person.	42
2495	For example, you're looking at monkey DNA.	42
2496	Have I mentioned I don't trust the system?	42
2497	Have you considered sub-standard day care?	42
2498	Have your boyfriend give me those samples.	42
2499	He caught me with her, got me with a rake.	42
2500	He said he got them playing flag football.	42
2501	He wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.	42
2502	Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal.	42
2503	He's probably not eating all that healthy.	42
2504	Bright side-- they're probably up weeping.	42
2505	But don't worry-- it's not gonna end here.	42
2506	But he never had the power to overrule me.	42
2507	But I've got two, and this woman has none.	42
2508	Chances are his mental state will improve.	42
2509	Dr.House! My daughter's care is my choice.	42
2510	Could his dad's melanoma be a factor here?	42
2511	Counts for nothing if you can't defend it.	42
2512	Can you stay out of trouble for five days?	42
2513	And a little of, Who the hell is this guy?	42
2514	And I mean that metaphorically, of course.	42
2515	And that was supposed to be the end of it.	42
2516	Are you sure you don't want to start over?	42
2517	As it grew larger, so did the confessions.	42
2518	Back home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos.	42
2519	Blood work shows high levels of prolactin.	42
2520	Because I think I'm having a heart attack.	42
2521	Anti-anxiety medications would explain it.	42
2522	Apparently, you were right about that one.	42
2523	Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.	42
2524	Add the enlarged lymph node, macrocytosis.	42
2525	Well, no, because the interest isn't fake.	42
2526	Very interesting practice you must've run.	42
2527	We didn't guess it because nobody gets it.	42
2528	What exactly are they building back there?	42
2529	We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.	42
2530	What if he has a heightened immune system?	42
2531	What looks like kidney disease, but isn't?	42
2532	What were you doing when the pain came on?	42
2533	The job went away, but not the profession.	42
2534	The original script was-- - Shh, shh, shh.	42
2535	That new transmission I put in your truck.	42
2536	They putting a claim on all of my Vicodin.	42
2537	This case boils down to he said, she said.	42
2538	This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist.	42
2539	You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there.	42
2540	You're trying to screw with my confidence.	42
2541	Yes, and they want a controlling interest.	42
2542	Yes, I-- I did have some pictures on that.	42
2543	Your stock price will be completely cured.	42
2544	Worst case, could be an ectopic pregnancy.	42
2545	Would you shut the blinds on your way out?	42
2546	Yeah, the fact that we work well together.	42
2547	You can't be embarrassed about a manicure.	42
2548	You forced me to go with the options here.	42
2549	You found one thing you both like or hate.	42
2550	You have a wonderful way of communicating.	42
2551	You have your own bathroom and office now.	42
2552	You must have broken into the wrong house.	42
2553	You no longer have access to this patient.	42
2554	You remember the antibiotic they gave you?	42
2555	You think she fell out of bed, repeatedly?	42
2556	You were cagey about where you were going.	42
2557	It's called Alice in Wonderland syndrome.	41
2558	It's clear you're back working for House.	41
2559	It's consistent with all of her symptoms.	41
2560	In which case, you cannot take his money.	41
2561	Is everyone trying to think of an answer?	41
2562	Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena.	41
2563	Maybe he found out about her good friend.	41
2564	Life with mom and dad was kind of a drag.	41
2565	It's really screwed up to romanticize it.	41
2566	It's the neurochemical basis for bonding.	41
2567	I've been second-guessing myself all day.	41
2568	Joint pain is common, but not definitive.	41
2569	Judge's order for your immediate release.	41
2570	Just betting on myself to solve the case.	41
2571	I was giving you the gift of deniability.	41
2572	I'll dress 'em the same, like in Vertigo.	41
2573	I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs.	41
2574	I'm proud to have been a part of it, but.	41
2575	I'd want my husband to tell me the truth.	41
2576	If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant.	41
2577	I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.	41
2578	Now we're back to boring reality reality.	41
2579	Otherwise, he could be accused of caring.	41
2580	My husband sank it when he cheated on me.	41
2581	Not sure that's relevant to the equation.	41
2582	Noradrenaline and near-death experiences.	41
2583	So why don't you do the smart thing here?	41
2584	Switching rooms can be very disorienting.	41
2585	Still mad about what happened in the lab?	41
2586	Some think it's quite a natural reaction.	41
2587	She gave up her life to take care of him.	41
2588	Showing weakness is what gets you killed.	41
2589	I haven't left the hospital in four days.	41
2590	I heard you're on that short time, House?	41
2591	I hope, one day, they'll understand that.	41
2592	I had a closed session hearing last week.	41
2593	I figure I could live off $25,000 a year.	41
2594	How are things between you and your wife?	41
2595	How could that possibly work as a tactic?	41
2596	His heart, liver, kidneys were all toast.	41
2597	His paranoia started at least a year ago.	41
2598	I can't comment on the drunk or the frat.	41
2599	Double shifts, just to keep the power on.	41
2600	Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.	41
2601	Fever's a little high, but it still fits.	41
2602	Fresh fruit in prison is usually chicken.	41
2603	He doesn't test positive for that either.	41
2604	He has high-frequency hearing impairment.	41
2605	He must think that I hired him to attack.	41
2606	He thinks three steps ahead, so I do too.	41
2607	He'll be even more motivated to beat you.	41
2608	He's the most rational man I've ever met.	41
2609	He's actually perfect for the drug trial.	41
2610	But I've never seen you use rosary beads.	41
2611	But not guilty enough to stop seeing her.	41
2612	Certain drugs could explain her reaction.	41
2613	Druggies are not known for their honesty.	41
2614	Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.	41
2615	Diphtheria paralyzing the ocular muscles?	41
2616	And a lot of people owe me wedding gifts.	41
2617	And Dr.House is sure that's what she has?	41
2618	And he seemed happy and he seemed normal.	41
2619	All we do is take money from sick people.	41
2620	All parents think their kids are special.	41
2621	And yet your first thought was frostbite?	41
2622	Blood count and protein count are normal.	41
2623	Been in and out of rehab, ve up clowning.	41
2624	Any chance that could happen before 9:00?	41
2625	We're not gonna tell him he was molested?	41
2626	We're out of time when we're out of time.	41
2627	Were you taking Vicodin during this case?	41
2628	Well, I guess I don't have a son anymore.	41
2629	What happens when the stunt doesn't work?	41
2630	Why do you care if he works on two cases?	41
2631	Why don't you go home and get some sleep?	41
2632	Which brings us back to, why do you care?	41
2633	The change actually makes things simpler.	41
2634	The mood swings come on quickly, but, um.	41
2635	The usual safe ideas were not gonna work.	41
2636	The wife didn't know about the explosion.	41
2637	There are other ways to save the company.	41
2638	That doesn't mean you couldn't get angry.	41
2639	That's not a very shameful walk of shame.	41
2640	TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out.	41
2641	Two of you go find her and find out what.	41
2642	Unfortunately, that's not why we're here.	41
2643	There's no way that Robin gave me an STD.	41
2644	They get to just hang out and do nothing?	41
2645	Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours?	41
2646	Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet?	41
2647	This will be our last round of questions.	41
2648	You're out tonight on conditional parole.	41
2649	You're up against a lifetime of training.	41
2650	Wife keeps the doors on the house locked.	41
2651	Yes, I figured it was from the radiation.	41
2652	You'll feel better, and she'll feel what.	41
2653	Your job is to keep this machine running.	41
2654	You don't have to feel so guilty anymore.	41
2655	You have a spare tire in your car, right?	41
2656	You have no idea how bad I feel about it.	41
2657	It's good for a couple to share a hobby.	40
2658	It's just a stupid way to make a living.	40
2659	It's not looking good for Fahr's either.	40
2660	It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.	40
2661	I'm told that some people are just nice.	40
2662	In other words, loyalty gave him cancer.	40
2663	Internal neck trauma, that's impressive.	40
2664	Iris has dissociative identity disorder.	40
2665	Just really love being a doctor so much.	40
2666	It's the swab for wheat-based allergies.	40
2667	It's usually a sign of a skull fracture.	40
2668	I've been ripping you all off for years.	40
2669	I've been waiting to do this for months.	40
2670	Joe, same thing with the engine rebuild.	40
2671	Just bought yourself months in solitary.	40
2672	It took my parents years to get over it.	40
2673	I'll get the car and meet you out front.	40
2674	I'm going to assume this is another one.	40
2675	If they're hiding inside the lung cells.	40
2676	If you get him, what's that gonna prove?	40
2677	I-I thought it made them deeper somehow.	40
2678	I take it you're in the latter category.	40
2679	I thought you were referring to talking.	40
2680	I told House I thought it was a mistake.	40
2681	I wanted to spend my life with him, but.	40
2682	Or she ripped off the band-aid too late.	40
2683	Phase one of operation outer office 2.0.	40
2684	My God, you have super-human discipline.	40
2685	Not as far as our lawyers are concerned.	40
2686	Not as much as House's surprise attacks.	40
2687	No, we already tested his liver enzymes.	40
2688	So you just wanted to look pretty on TV.	40
2689	So he was obviously afraid of something.	40
2690	Taped under your chair is an index card.	40
2691	Start him on extracorporeal circulation.	40
2692	Start the patient on high-dose steroids.	40
2693	Some cute young nurse baked you cookies?	40
2694	Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.	40
2695	Pull! She responding to corticosteroids?	40
2696	She thinks I'm a prostitute on her turf.	40
2697	She's already got neurological symptoms.	40
2698	I guess I'm supposed to be the good cop.	40
2699	How's he gonna learn if we stop his act?	40
2700	I don't wanna come back to work for you.	40
2701	I know, which means you can't go either.	40
2702	I mean, he's constantly reminded of her.	40
2703	I missed the fact that you were married.	40
2704	I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.	40
2705	How'd you even know to look for a tumor?	40
2706	His liver enzymes are slightly elevated.	40
2707	House, I worked for you for seven years.	40
2708	I can't think of another interpretation.	40
2709	I didn't want the city to know about it.	40
2710	I didn't want you and the kids to worry.	40
2711	Eventually, you will screw something up.	40
2712	Haven't heard an indirect order in here.	40
2713	He can't function under someone's thumb.	40
2714	Gain back at least some of the function.	40
2715	But that's not the idea House went with.	40
2716	But then you'll get out, and unlike you.	40
2717	But why don't you assume no recent meds?	40
2718	Chase said you had something to tell me.	40
2719	Eerily felt like the best-case scenario.	40
2720	CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.	40
2721	Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.	40
2722	Dean of Medicine from your old hospital.	40
2723	Did you use metaphors for your old team?	40
2724	Do you feel any tightness in your chest?	40
2725	Do you really believe in this diagnosis?	40
2726	Does your ex leave a spare key anywhere?	40
2727	Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter.	40
2728	And if she says she has been vaccinated?	40
2729	And now you're gonna tell me you didn't.	40
2730	And then I could donate my other organs.	40
2731	2011 is the bicentennial of their birth.	40
2732	Adams! They're gonna revoke your parole.	40
2733	Are you trying to make this easy for me?	40
2734	At the time, it seemed like a good idea.	40
2735	And why did House think that was stupid?	40
2736	And you want to do some insider trading?	40
2737	And you won't be able to prove anything.	40
2738	Ben, I-I don't think that's a good idea.	40
2739	Because he doesn't treat them like scum.	40
2740	Angry at God or I just need a challenge?	40
2741	Well, I'd take me if either of us could.	40
2742	Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fever.	40
2743	We booked the O.R. for an hour from now.	40
2744	We he him on the donor list for a liver.	40
2745	Well, I can't just leave this up to her.	40
2746	What if the lung involvement came first?	40
2747	Why would she think you're a prostitute?	40
2748	The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.	40
2749	The Berry aneurysm must have just burst.	40
2750	The bulge wasn't caused by pus or blood.	40
2751	The symptoms fit, and Andrews is a hack.	40
2752	The way her eyes looked when she smiled.	40
2753	Then I decided I should test his wallet.	40
2754	Thinks he had a heart attack but didn't.	40
2755	This doesn't change anything between us.	40
2756	This is about you covering your own ass.	40
2757	This is the only way that I can do this.	40
2758	Those guys made decisions you supported?	40
2759	Thought you only had clinic on Tuesdays.	40
2760	You've been in a coma for several hours.	40
2761	You've never done this before, have you?	40
2762	You're not helping Chase or our patient.	40
2763	You're letting him get inside your head.	40
2764	You're just setting yourself up to fail.	40
2765	Your daughter is better off without you.	40
2766	Your guilt is between you and your wife.	40
2767	Yeah, it's the word might that bumps me.	40
2768	You do read the school paper, don't you?	40
2769	you need to go prepare for your hearing.	40
2770	You said he was at Princeton-Plainsboro?	40
2771	You said that 9:00 was the premium slot.	40
2772	I'm trying to keep House out of prison.	39
2773	Imaginary medicine is not my specialty.	39
2774	In the pool is the neighbor's daughter.	39
2775	Isn't that the point of having a spare?	39
2776	Maternal grandmother's worse than that.	39
2777	Just like sane people can be illogical.	39
2778	It got, like, over 75,000 hits already.	39
2779	It just appeared in the last few weeks.	39
2780	It just wouldn't be good for my health.	39
2781	I was gonna make you bring me a bottle.	39
2782	I'll clear it with your parole officer.	39
2783	I'm not really an affair guy after all.	39
2784	If you like tuna, you're a little late.	39
2785	If you stay, we have to have a hearing.	39
2786	If you're looking for someone to blame.	39
2787	ICU stands for take your time in Latin.	39
2788	If it was GAD, he'd be having seizures.	39
2789	I think we should run a pregnancy test.	39
2790	I started the last round of pleconaril.	39
2791	I think I really dodged a bullet there.	39
2792	I want your stereo and your headphones.	39
2793	I wanted you to move on with your life.	39
2794	Only the bleeding's medically relevant.	39
2795	Or is it about something more profound?	39
2796	Patient's visited China a lot recently.	39
2797	People who just get off on weird cases.	39
2798	Not outside the walls of this hospital.	39
2799	Saving us both from contraband charges.	39
2800	Second half of my plan might need work.	39
2801	Regular stock this time, nice and safe.	39
2802	Still could have done permanent damage.	39
2803	Something very obvious and very boring.	39
2804	Outside this room, I pay you to parrot.	39
2805	Paint fumes didn't cause contamination.	39
2806	Park, do you have an opening statement.	39
2807	Sex can wane in any marriage over time.	39
2808	She took a bet that she knew she'd win.	39
2809	I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.	39
2810	I get why he wants to go to that fight.	39
2811	I don't plan on being homeless forever.	39
2812	I know I have to pay attention to them.	39
2813	I know you don't want me here, but, um.	39
2814	I know you're the better diagnostician.	39
2815	I love them more than anything, I just.	39
2816	How soon will they know if it's cancer?	39
2817	His house is not gonna be low priority.	39
2818	His liver's not cleaning out his blood.	39
2819	Hoping everything else will come later.	39
2820	I assume you concur with the diagnosis.	39
2821	I can refuse to see any visitor I want.	39
2822	Find out what's causing the meningitis.	39
2823	He just got them a couple of weeks ago.	39
2824	He was given fluids, and he got better.	39
2825	He'd have his own words for everything.	39
2826	He'll be able to go home in a few days.	39
2827	Get Black Beauty and meet me out front.	39
2828	Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.	39
2829	Go! We need to operate right now, okay?	39
2830	Hey, hey, don't point that thing at me.	39
2831	But we haven't reached the stomach yet.	39
2832	'Cause I wanted you to hear it from me.	39
2833	Chase certainly doesn't try to hide it.	39
2834	Chris Christie recommends the pancakes.	39
2835	Call her family, her friends, her work.	39
2836	Can only make better choices from here.	39
2837	Can we get to my patient sometime soon?	39
2838	Did you get all the Vicodin you needed?	39
2839	And that haircut isn't helping, either.	39
2840	A few minutes after I started the IVIG.	39
2841	14-year-old girl, intermittent attacks.	39
2842	After he lost his son, he lost his job.	39
2843	As long as I keep bringing her muffins.	39
2844	Bobby was very insistent on that point.	39
2845	Being homeless isn't a vacation for me.	39
2846	Being normal is very important to Iris.	39
2847	Because you're paranoid about paranoia.	39
2848	We've been separated for almost a year.	39
2849	What about posttraumatic syringomyelia?	39
2850	Well, I'm gonna go through the laundry.	39
2851	Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?	39
2852	was the only neurologist I could reach.	39
2853	We actually started calling her Sophie.	39
2854	We can do a lumbar puncture to confirm.	39
2855	We did a major operation for no reason.	39
2856	We got an order to reduce overcrowding.	39
2857	We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.	39
2858	Wait, is this like a bucket list thing?	39
2859	Why should you have to spend the night?	39
2860	Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it?	39
2861	Why do you wanna give away your kidney?	39
2862	Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.	39
2863	Which will be bad news for both of you.	39
2864	Who's better qualified to be the daddy?	39
2865	Then leave it up to me, and just leave.	39
2866	There really was nothing for him to do.	39
2867	That last insult was your cue to leave.	39
2868	That's not what you wanted to tell her.	39
2869	To help people the way I always wanted.	39
2870	Uh, excuse me, miss, what is your name?	39
2871	Uh, you use it to get food from inside.	39
2872	Sure, I'll feel guilty, start doubting.	39
2873	There's a canal near my mother's house.	39
2874	There's a hospital two miles from here.	39
2875	This is why we stopped the antiemetics.	39
2876	You've got one employee, one volunteer.	39
2877	You're not gonna close the wound first?	39
2878	Your mom sends you to work with snacks.	39
2879	Yeah! It's called an acoustical shadow.	39
2880	You asked me to call and recommend you.	39
2881	You break the law, you go back to jail.	39
2882	You give away two kidneys, and you die.	39
2883	You go to that fight, you go to prison.	39
2884	You knew on Monday, you get out Friday.	39
2885	You mentioned your car was in the shop.	39
2886	You probably don't even think it's GAD.	39
2887	You really think I care about your car?	39
2888	It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.	38
2889	It's even crazier than the gift thing.	38
2890	Is there any way to take the edge off?	38
2891	It can wait till you finish your work.	38
2892	Know how I got interested in medicine?	38
2893	I've been eating wheat my entire life.	38
2894	I've never been hit in the eye before.	38
2895	I've paged a team of our best doctors.	38
2896	John Woo movies, romance novels, kale.	38
2897	It might help if we knew the question.	38
2898	I'm gonna have to dial back the nitro.	38
2899	I'm ju reading the notes on your desk.	38
2900	I'm not emotionally involved with her.	38
2901	I'm really just keeping the seat warm.	38
2902	I think you refer to it as petty cash.	38
2903	I still don't think it's neurological.	38
2904	I thought the bracelet was decorative.	38
2905	I would have gone with colossal drunk.	38
2906	I would just be you telling the truth.	38
2907	I wouldn't blame anyone if you decide.	38
2908	I wouldn't mind a couple more details.	38
2909	One of them was a head CT, which uses.	38
2910	On all of us Thank God you called him.	38
2911	Now that they know, they'll report me.	38
2912	Or I say thank you for not killing me.	38
2913	Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.	38
2914	Plaques could be confused for nodules.	38
2915	No you, no medicine, no fixing people.	38
2916	Not quite sure what box to check here.	38
2917	Not unless that file has a file in it.	38
2918	So you need to prove your superiority.	38
2919	Speaks to a certain callousness on Dr.	38
2920	Ray! Let's just get out of here, okay?	38
2921	Probably not contagious at this point.	38
2922	She treated it like it never happened.	38
2923	She wants to go back to the monastery.	38
2924	Should be out of here within the week.	38
2925	I genuinely wonder who they belong to.	38
2926	I don't want to miss the opening bell.	38
2927	I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.	38
2928	I might have cleared it with the cops.	38
2929	I only help those who can help myself.	38
2930	How do you know your boyfriend's okay?	38
2931	I can't ask someone to do that for me.	38
2932	Hey, we're having a conversation here.	38
2933	Even though there are three diagnoses?	38
2934	Excuse me, Your Honor, may I approach?	38
2935	Family members only during procedures.	38
2936	Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.	38
2937	Funded and staffed his own department.	38
2938	He was a character in the Flintsteins.	38
2939	He wasn't trying to pull anybody away.	38
2940	Heart rate's 140, pressure's dropping.	38
2941	Hence the attire, hence the tardiness.	38
2942	He's threatening to show your husband.	38
2943	But technically it will still pay off.	38
2944	But that'll destroy the good lung too.	38
2945	But that's what white blood cells are.	38
2946	'Cause that doctor didn't believe you?	38
2947	Calming, but with a hint of nurturing.	38
2948	By definition, you have nothing to do.	38
2949	Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin.	38
2950	Could be a sign of cerebral infection.	38
2951	Could have moved on to the real thing.	38
2952	Cuddy threatened him with clinic duty.	38
2953	Death is a consequence, not a symptom.	38
2954	Do you mind stepping out for a moment?	38
2955	Does that mean you like your new life?	38
2956	Doesn't change how I make an incision.	38
2957	And by money, you mean all your money.	38
2958	And completely divorced from humanity.	38
2959	A little less guilty about seeing her.	38
2960	All right, I'll take the other ticket.	38
2961	Bobby is an incredibly fun, great guy.	38
2962	Antique locket-- it's unpolished gold.	38
2963	Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.	38
2964	Are you checking up on me or on House?	38
2965	We can't talk about this case anymore.	38
2966	We don't even have a tv in our office.	38
2967	We married six months after I met him.	38
2968	We need to catch the end of our class.	38
2969	We need you to help us with something.	38
2970	We're close to the point of no return.	38
2971	We're going to the hospital for tests.	38
2972	We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.	38
2973	What if it's not an allergic reaction?	38
2974	What was the point of the orange hair?	38
2975	Which actually doesn't prove anything.	38
2976	Which one of you is the cheap bastard?	38
2977	Wh-what if I don't want the treatment?	38
2978	That's why Drew made up his own words.	38
2979	Then we can shock it back into rhythm.	38
2980	That's everything bad that's happened.	38
2981	Turns out they monitor these monitors.	38
2982	This guy's the only one with symptoms.	38
2983	This has nothing to do with the truth.	38
2984	You're not going to get any rest here.	38
2985	You're the one who brought Andrews in.	38
2986	You're completely unhireable anywhere.	38
2987	Your brain is exploding with oxytocin.	38
2988	You are a good man who made a mistake.	38
2989	You clearly wrote that after the fact.	38
2990	You do have to treat me appropriately.	38
2991	You feeling any pain or cramping here?	38
2992	You obviously lied about sex and this.	38
2993	You say that like it's not gonna work.	38
2994	You should probably lie down and rest.	38
2995	You were gonna send me back to prison.	38
2996	He smacked his head against the wall.	37
2997	It's never actually been used before.	37
2998	I'm thinking occult long QT syndrome?	37
2999	Is that, like, a synonym for clever ?	37
3000	is the only thing that keeps me here.	37
3001	Is there someone you want me to call?	37
3002	I'm sorry I lied, but-- I know, okay.	37
3003	Look, the point is I saw this coming.	37
3004	Let them spend five minutes together.	37
3005	Jane Doe is flourishing without them.	37
3006	I was expecting a battery of lawyers.	37
3007	I'm betting on them both being yours.	37
3008	I'll--I'll bet some of them bore you.	37
3009	I'm just disagreeing, not overruling.	37
3010	I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.	37
3011	If it makes Andrews look sympathetic.	37
3012	I think you should cancel my hearing.	37
3013	I think you're having a heart attack.	37
3014	I think you're right about the strep.	37
3015	I thought I was right about the rash.	37
3016	I think he actually has a good point.	37
3017	I used to wait until you went to bed.	37
3018	I wanted you to do a tilt table test.	37
3019	I was angry, but I wasn't distracted.	37
3020	I would never do something like that.	37
3021	Now I'm trying to start my life over.	37
3022	Or do you want to do a cavity search?	37
3023	Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky.	37
3024	No, it was my idea! Seriously, House?	37
3025	My boys have a roof over their heads.	37
3026	Not that I wasn't struggling with it.	37
3027	Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.	37
3028	Negative for all our other exposures.	37
3029	So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.	37
3030	So for the past few months I've been.	37
3031	So this was a team-building exercise?	37
3032	Said he'd have his decision tomorrow.	37
3033	Saying no will cause both of us pain.	37
3034	See if I can handle working with him.	37
3035	Region was endemic with dengue fever.	37
3036	Taking her off made it more apparent.	37
3037	Swelling would have followed gravity.	37
3038	Something we think we know He did it.	37
3039	She confirmed he's been feeling fine.	37
3040	She didn't complain about a headache.	37
3041	She robbed them of 12 years together.	37
3042	She's not drinking the coffee either.	37
3043	I just came for a chat with a friend.	37
3044	I have enough problems with this job.	37
3045	I knew you could never do that to me.	37
3046	How do you work with a guy like that?	37
3047	How about you drop it in your office?	37
3048	I borrowed it from one of the nurses.	37
3049	I can understand the rationalization.	37
3050	I can't believe how stupid I've been.	37
3051	I didn't want a big, emotional scene.	37
3052	I am a cripple in need of assistance.	37
3053	I could save four or five more lives.	37
3054	Foreman's gonna need a diagnostician.	37
3055	Forget nun, you slept with a patient?	37
3056	He could do a lot of damage in there.	37
3057	Goes to school and makes good grades.	37
3058	But I didn't want to, and he got mad.	37
3059	But it's definitely on the wish list.	37
3060	But there's always a chance we can't.	37
3061	But you don't love all your patients?	37
3062	'Cause your car is still in the shop.	37
3063	Chase is just looking in your throat.	37
3064	Can you feel the sheets on your skin?	37
3065	Don't we need to get you to a doctor?	37
3066	Did someone come take her for a test?	37
3067	did you think I was referring to sex?	37
3068	Do you really want to do that to her?	37
3069	And Chase brought a scalpel in there.	37
3070	And now everybody's talking about it.	37
3071	14-year-old, your freedom, our asses?	37
3072	arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors.	37
3073	At least you two have that in common.	37
3074	At least, that's what I've been told.	37
3075	And you've always-- What's that from?	37
3076	And, most important, hence the anger.	37
3077	Been working for House for two weeks.	37
3078	Benjamin! Benjamin, wait! Oh, my God.	37
3079	Because you realize they're not dull.	37
3080	Because, because This is all you get.	37
3081	Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?	37
3082	Andrews is the one that should leave.	37
3083	Used to have to pretend I was scared.	37
3084	We asked about toxins on the history.	37
3085	We have to wheel this out to the MRI.	37
3086	We need to talk about Saturday night.	37
3087	Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes.	37
3088	What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?	37
3089	When I paid him a visit, he took off.	37
3090	That's what those vitamin pills were.	37
3091	The aneurysm is just another symptom.	37
3092	The man she married no longer exists.	37
3093	The secretary said you were on leave.	37
3094	That'd mean the damage was permanent.	37
3095	That's not supposed to happen, right?	37
3096	The patient was punched in the groin.	37
3097	There's someone I would like to call.	37
3098	They decided that your being stabbed.	37
3099	Y-you want to stop seeing each other?	37
3100	You're saying he should defer to you?	37
3101	You're trying to make me look stupid.	37
3102	You're bleeding through your bandage.	37
3103	Your parents know your call schedule?	37
3104	You're allowed to be at the hospital.	37
3105	Would have made my life a lot easier.	37
3106	Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious.	37
3107	You also wouldn't have to be at work.	37
3108	You don't even know what I just said.	37
3109	You know, don't send out the marines.	37
3110	You mind trying to find me a cricket?	37
3111	You need us to fix this little piggy?	37
3112	You never even tried to analyze this?	37
3113	You of all people should know better.	37
3114	You went out of your way to help her.	37
3115	It's great to be back among friends.	36
3116	It's linked to type A personalities.	36
3117	In a lake or a pond or an everglade?	36
3118	Instead, I am going to lose $20,000.	36
3119	I'm still going to my pediatric one.	36
3120	It doesn't seem like much of a case.	36
3121	Is he sick because of the explosion?	36
3122	Keep them stable as long as you can.	36
3123	I've surfed all over the gold coast.	36
3124	Jiminy didn't chirp much last night.	36
3125	It's a clot in the radicular artery.	36
3126	I was crying, and he couldn't drive.	36
3127	I'll deny it, and he'll believe you.	36
3128	I'm gonna need number three Vicryls.	36
3129	I'm just looking for something more.	36
3130	If you move it, it'll be without me.	36
3131	I think she might make it this time.	36
3132	I told you my son didn't do cocaine.	36
3133	Oh, yeah, your-- grabbed your tushy.	36
3134	Oh, now, you two make a cute couple.	36
3135	One dead lobe means four alive ones.	36
3136	One of us is in the wrong time zone.	36
3137	Now that happened either because Dr.	36
3138	Otherwise, you are equally to blame.	36
3139	Pax River is, like, completely flat.	36
3140	No broken bones, no signs of trauma.	36
3141	My father, but-- His place or yours?	36
3142	So there's something wrong with her.	36
3143	So they'll never testify against me.	36
3144	Sir, are you questioning my resolve?	36
3145	See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.	36
3146	Seems like someone's feeling better.	36
3147	Please tell me if you hear anything.	36
3148	Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.	36
3149	Pull! Sights seem to be off on this.	36
3150	She's determined not to do it again.	36
3151	I just haven't felt the calling yet.	36
3152	I get that you're scared and guilty.	36
3153	I don't really care about the movie.	36
3154	I don't think it was anyone's fault.	36
3155	I just--I just bumped into the wall.	36
3156	I know you don't think I'm an idiot.	36
3157	I never went anywhere, did anything.	36
3158	I pay you to think inside this room.	36
3159	House, she really needs this kidney.	36
3160	I am an equal opportunity exploiter.	36
3161	Everybody has to pay for their sins.	36
3162	Find out what else he's lying about.	36
3163	He has no schistocytes in his smear.	36
3164	Get one in my cell after lights-out.	36
3165	He's shedding his skin like a snake.	36
3166	He's your friend, and he's not well.	36
3167	Good thing you made it all official.	36
3168	Got you a Reuben from the cafeteria.	36
3169	But daddy is weak and needs to know.	36
3170	But my department got defunded, and.	36
3171	But we went over the plans together.	36
3172	Chase basically called me a sellout.	36
3173	Copying him makes you look pathetic.	36
3174	Couldn't have said it better myself.	36
3175	Can you tell me what happened to me?	36
3176	Can you tell me what this is called?	36
3177	Deleted all photos of you and Anita.	36
3178	And that's why I went to Dr.Foreman.	36
3179	A skin resurfacing laser is missing.	36
3180	All right, this is getting annoying.	36
3181	According to this article, at least.	36
3182	Advanced enough, but no IV feedings.	36
3183	Ah, explains the hole in this chair.	36
3184	Blood chemistry showed high ammonia.	36
3185	Because I wanted to get out of here.	36
3186	Because the patient was unconscious.	36
3187	Because they don't know the real me.	36
3188	Are you gonna test my urine or what?	36
3189	What about another clotting problem?	36
3190	What about gifts from South America?	36
3191	Well, you obviously found something.	36
3192	We don't have the money to pay them.	36
3193	We found more alcohol at your house.	36
3194	We need to get reckless and extreme.	36
3195	We should make this a regular thing.	36
3196	What did you think was gonna happen?	36
3197	What's the hiring policy over there?	36
3198	Which is basically why we missed it.	36
3199	Wh-what if I had a history with, uh.	36
3200	Why are we stealing cable from here?	36
3201	That's the correct answer, isn't it?	36
3202	That's why you wanted companionship.	36
3203	The patient asked me what I thought.	36
3204	The problem was the patient's brain.	36
3205	That normally happens every 30 days.	36
3206	That should be enough for all of us.	36
3207	Took a job-- Don't need the details.	36
3208	Unless I need to say, mother, may I?	36
3209	These rug burns are from last night.	36
3210	They say my liver function's better.	36
3211	This is what you call going quickly?	36
3212	You're not giving it to me, are you?	36
3213	Would you mind watching them for us?	36
3214	You called Social Services for real.	36
3215	you can get that without having sex?	36
3216	You can leave when I have an answer.	36
3217	You can't take sex from a sexaholic.	36
3218	You clamp now, she could stroke out.	36
3219	You flip-flopped on parental rights.	36
3220	You haven't been that for two years.	36
3221	You obviously don't care what I did.	36
3222	You really do need psychiatric help.	36
3223	You said we were meeting for coffee.	36
3224	It's his heart we're worried about.	35
3225	it's normal pressure hydrocephalus.	35
3226	I'm totally fine with Taub or Park.	35
3227	In two months, I came running home.	35
3228	Iris hasn't had any severe traumas.	35
3229	I'm thinking of going hang gliding.	35
3230	Is that how little you think of me?	35
3231	Is this from the alcohol treatment?	35
3232	Is this supposed to itch like this?	35
3233	It could have been me on the floor.	35
3234	Kid needs a bone marrow transplant.	35
3235	Looks like you're ready to go home.	35
3236	Low white count suggests infection.	35
3237	Massive amounts choke up the lungs.	35
3238	Let's go through it point by point.	35
3239	Just when they're beginning to, uh.	35
3240	It's why I wanted to work with you.	35
3241	Just a sore throat a few weeks ago.	35
3242	It sucks that there was a stabbing.	35
3243	It was a perfect diagnostic moment.	35
3244	It was a pretty tough conversation.	35
3245	It was a three-plus 20 minutes ago.	35
3246	I was eating a baby for lunch, and.	35
3247	I'll buy options instead of shares.	35
3248	I'm gonna start him on ceftriaxone.	35
3249	I'm guessing it's a little of both.	35
3250	If you really love them back, then.	35
3251	I thought of you on mom's birthday.	35
3252	I think he's about to throw us out.	35
3253	I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.	35
3254	I wanted to spend my life with you.	35
3255	Okay, that's--y-- Yeah, yeah, yeah.	35
3256	Occlusion time 9:46 and 23 seconds.	35
3257	No, it's on the palms of his hands.	35
3258	Middle ear looks completely normal.	35
3259	Nothing! You can't prove otherwise.	35
3260	Not all migraines present that way.	35
3261	So go back to work at the hospital.	35
3262	So he could die before he gets one.	35
3263	So I'm just lying about everything?	35
3264	Taub, Chase, Thirteen all moved on.	35
3265	Technically, you're back right now.	35
3266	Some people think it's burning now.	35
3267	Repeat this, no ifs, ands, or buts.	35
3268	Right now's not a good time, House.	35
3269	Please just let me get out of here.	35
3270	Poison wouldn't have to be in food.	35
3271	Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.	35
3272	She doesn't seem to like that idea.	35
3273	She listens to me, I waste an hour.	35
3274	She'd spend all her money on pills.	35
3275	She's writing my opening statement.	35
3276	I just need to see how far it goes.	35
3277	I have a chance to really watch it.	35
3278	I got one final confession to make.	35
3279	I saw the boy who I was caring for.	35
3280	I don't want to needle the carotid.	35
3281	I need to get a jump on this thing.	35
3282	I now accept, that your all better.	35
3283	I prepared the sarcophagus for you.	35
3284	His heart rate's finally elevating.	35
3285	His late father was a circus clown.	35
3286	HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.	35
3287	House, we gotta evacuate this area.	35
3288	Hey, thanks for doing this in here.	35
3289	I do this demonstration every year.	35
3290	I don't care if we might need them.	35
3291	I could have given you a Section 8.	35
3292	I could live on dialyses for years.	35
3293	Even if he didn't light up himself.	35
3294	Have you ever watched one of those?	35
3295	Have you seen Bride of the Monster?	35
3296	He came up with the figure, not me.	35
3297	Her blood pressure's been elevated.	35
3298	God, this is exactly what I needed.	35
3299	Hey! Sit down! Where's the aspirin?	35
3300	But how can you not be traumatized?	35
3301	But I need to see down your barrel.	35
3302	But I'm glad it's going to someone.	35
3303	But I'm not-- I'm not an alcoholic.	35
3304	Causes the symptoms to come and go.	35
3305	Ehrlichiosis causing bronchialitis.	35
3306	Can you wiggle your fingers for me?	35
3307	Bigger question is why that worked.	35
3308	Denise never wants to see me again.	35
3309	Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?	35
3310	Didn't answer your page last night.	35
3311	Do I need to pull out another card?	35
3312	And amusing myself at your expense.	35
3313	And I am not ready to give up this.	35
3314	Actually, it's your mom's decision.	35
3315	Are you telling me you didn't care?	35
3316	Are you thinking that maybe-- what?	35
3317	And why are you asking me about it?	35
3318	Any type of birth control can fail.	35
3319	Also explains the motorcycle crash.	35
3320	, and you're gonna go back to jail.	35
3321	We've gotta stop seeing each other.	35
3322	What about squamous cell carcinoma?	35
3323	Well, you lied about the boyfriend.	35
3324	Vomiting must have torn the lining.	35
3325	Wait a minute, what's the big deal?	35
3326	Use the people already on the case.	35
3327	Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.	35
3328	We don't know if you're better yet.	35
3329	We just need to know what happened.	35
3330	We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg.	35
3331	We still have no clue what's wrong.	35
3332	We're going to the Doctor's office.	35
3333	Why didn't you tell me that before?	35
3334	Which idiot did the pregnancy test?	35
3335	Who obviously didn't take his vows.	35
3336	The E.R. Docs interviewed his wife.	35
3337	That could have happened to anyone.	35
3338	That doesn't mean I have a problem.	35
3339	That fire, the bruise on your face.	35
3340	That last one may not be universal.	35
3341	That's not from a fungal infection.	35
3342	Unless he was still being poisoned.	35
3343	Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.	35
3344	There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.	35
3345	They had banana muffins downstairs.	35
3346	This was the fastest way to get it.	35
3347	This woman seems perfectly healthy.	35
3348	You're not gonna put her on bypass?	35
3349	You're angry because your kid died.	35
3350	Yes, it gives you a responsibility.	35
3351	Your altruism was always a symptom.	35
3352	Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm.	35
3353	Your patient is two lungs in a box.	35
3354	Wilson says it's not breast cancer.	35
3355	You don't want to move to Portland?	35
3356	You need help with the lacerations?	35
3357	You show all the classic behaviors.	35
3358	You told me i was going to be okay.	35
3359	Nurse Williams to social services.	34
3360	It's actually not such a big deal.	34
3361	It's just good to hear your voice.	34
3362	It's med-speak for she's an idiot.	34
3363	I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.	34
3364	I'm waiting for some test results.	34
3365	Iris has always been a moody girl.	34
3366	Is an ultrasound really necessary?	34
3367	Kapur and Carlyle are unavailable.	34
3368	Looks like you've gone viral, Hon.	34
3369	let her be better off without you.	34
3370	It's this new curve control thing.	34
3371	It happened so fast, I did--I-- I.	34
3372	It means we were wrong about lead.	34
3373	It was nice to meet you, Benjamin.	34
3374	I was right about the antiemetics.	34
3375	I was thinking just the two of us.	34
3376	I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.	34
3377	I'm not not the relationship type.	34
3378	I'm not saying I don't have faith.	34
3379	I'm not seeing an embryo anywhere.	34
3380	I'm not seeing any calcifications.	34
3381	I'm not the man you thought I was.	34
3382	I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.	34
3383	If you kill him, we're looking at.	34
3384	If you were me, what would you do?	34
3385	I thought you had a team for that.	34
3386	I went through a rebellious phase.	34
3387	One box in the bottom of a closet.	34
3388	Okay, look, I know who I am, okay?	34
3389	Oh, and that was Checkmate, right?	34
3390	Notify his employer, his landlord.	34
3391	Now we're the ones being paranoid.	34
3392	only one of you will be in prison.	34
3393	Patient's heart valves are normal.	34
3394	People who got something to prove.	34
3395	My leg is no good at judging time.	34
3396	My mom will be happy to hear that.	34
3397	Means we're wrong about infection.	34
3398	Not dead until he's warm and dead.	34
3399	Never afraid to show his emotions.	34
3400	So this is the family's best hope.	34
3401	Taub is interrogating the janitor.	34
3402	Thank you so much for coming here.	34
3403	Still does a few orders from home.	34
3404	Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.	34
3405	Pop! Is that supposed to be funny?	34
3406	Question is, why did he want that?	34
3407	She doesn't even have a boyfriend.	34
3408	She doesn't have a Berry aneurysm.	34
3409	She hasn't even sipped the coffee.	34
3410	She's moved on-- new hub, new kid.	34
3411	I just said I don't feel anything.	34
3412	I know about your deal with Adams.	34
3413	I never meant to hurt my daughter.	34
3414	I never said that wasn't possible.	34
3415	How do you know about ceftriaxone?	34
3416	How can there be that much tissue.	34
3417	His body wasn't disposing of iron.	34
3418	His kidneys died, they transfused.	34
3419	House prefers chaos over cohesion.	34
3420	House, the nurses saw you come in.	34
3421	Hey, we both assaulted our bosses.	34
3422	I don't know when I'm coming back.	34
3423	From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act.	34
3424	For it to affect a pool of plasma.	34
3425	He got them playing flag football.	34
3426	He had a bleeding problem earlier.	34
3427	He has stridor but no obstruction.	34
3428	He thought Taub's idea was stupid.	34
3429	He was giving me a ride home, and.	34
3430	He was the only boy that liked me.	34
3431	Gentle is the sun It's been years.	34
3432	Goes to the witness's credibility.	34
3433	Hey, hey, hey! I need backup here.	34
3434	Gets another sleepover with da-da.	34
3435	He's been incredibly well-behaved.	34
3436	He's destroying thousands of jobs.	34
3437	He's done everything you've asked.	34
3438	But each time, it's just the best.	34
3439	But I didn't mean physical stress.	34
3440	But that's as low as I'm gonna go.	34
3441	But we wound up finding something.	34
3442	'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a.	34
3443	Classic presentation of infection.	34
3444	Dr.Park is searching the registry.	34
3445	Could he know I'm good with a gun?	34
3446	Did your son ever smoke marijuana?	34
3447	Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.	34
3448	Do you know what's wrong with her?	34
3449	And her shoulder pain is all gone.	34
3450	And I told you I wasn't listening.	34
3451	And that is exactly what happened.	34
3452	And then we ended up at the motel.	34
3453	Abdominal ultrasound was negative.	34
3454	All parents screw up all children.	34
3455	Aren't there actual medical tests?	34
3456	and there ain't no one Bye, House.	34
3457	And you should update your resume.	34
3458	And you're a super-duper audience.	34
3459	Boo-yah! Pfft! Boo-yah to you too.	34
3460	Because this is a bad idea, House.	34
3461	We can start as soon as next week.	34
3462	We need to track down all of them.	34
3463	We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine.	34
3464	We should continue plasmapheresis.	34
3465	Wait, we're gonna be here a while.	34
3466	Why do you think I'm on buspirone?	34
3467	Why doesn't Chase have to be here?	34
3468	Which means he wasn't really hurt.	34
3469	Who cares how they found it, okay?	34
3470	That's why he'd lie to the guards.	34
3471	The anesthesia's just wearing off.	34
3472	The evidence pointed to psychosis.	34
3473	The first one was regarding Chase.	34
3474	The lung donor didn't have cancer.	34
3475	Then animal cases and ghost cases.	34
3476	There is a free clinic in Trenton.	34
3477	That doesn't make me a bad person.	34
3478	That only takes a couple of hours.	34
3479	That's a side effect of not dying.	34
3480	That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.	34
3481	To avoid having this conversation.	34
3482	To keep me from lying to patients?	34
3483	Two lives are in the balance here.	34
3484	there's no sign of tropheryma DNA.	34
3485	This will calm your immune system.	34
3486	Y-you mean the treatment will, um.	34
3487	You were wrong about encephalitis.	34
3488	You will be eloquent in your loss.	34
3489	Wife used to run a floral company.	34
3490	Your heart said he needed to know.	34
3491	Your small airways are collapsing.	34
3492	You're a smart, successful doctor.	34
3493	Yeah, like you losing your parole.	34
3494	You add them all together, we get.	34
3495	You didn't need to shoot yourself.	34
3496	You don't wanna mess with Stomper.	34
3497	You got at least a trillion cells.	34
3498	You like your life that way it is.	34
3499	You really want to improve things?	34
3500	You think he's allergic to Iodine?	34
3501	You think his sexuality is normal?	34
3502	Well, I think we've heard enough.	33
3503	It's called tumor lysis syndrome.	33
3504	It's not diagnostically relevant.	33
3505	I'm sorry, did you say something?	33
3506	Like, not even a bottle of water?	33
3507	Lead exposure's a nice diagnosis.	33
3508	Let's get the lungs on treatment.	33
3509	Just tell me your initial theory.	33
3510	Just trying to help you out here.	33
3511	It's probably aseptic meningitis.	33
3512	It's where we had our first date.	33
3513	It must be the descending branch.	33
3514	It was my fault daddy's-- Oh, no.	33
3515	I was thinking of something more.	33
3516	I'll be deciding your fate today.	33
3517	I'll be here as much as you need.	33
3518	I'm gonna call the ambulance! No.	33
3519	I'm gonna do a quick breast exam.	33
3520	I'm gonna get through eventually.	33
3521	I'm more clever and more devious.	33
3522	I still have my software company.	33
3523	I think I might have said insane.	33
3524	I wanted to see how deep it went.	33
3525	I would love to be able to do it.	33
3526	I wouldn't have been in the room.	33
3527	Obviously he knows a lot of cops.	33
3528	Notify the dad's sexual partners.	33
3529	Only with fewer bums with herpes.	33
3530	Ortho still has the outer office.	33
3531	Perfectly reasonable explanation.	33
3532	No way Rollo'd diss me like that.	33
3533	My husband saw you in the clinic.	33
3534	My mom, she died four months ago.	33
3535	Means it's not Zollinger-Ellison.	33
3536	Not if the vomiting's persistent.	33
3537	Not looking for anything serious.	33
3538	Never knew you were such a tramp.	33
3539	Never was raped, not raped-raped.	33
3540	So I'm gonna be completely cured.	33
3541	So this is you trying to help me?	33
3542	Scam extra Vicodin, back to jail.	33
3543	Rollo followed me in and took it.	33
3544	Tell him to keep his hand off me.	33
3545	Steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.	33
3546	Seems to have done you some good.	33
3547	Some other nut pulling a scalpel?	33
3548	She's a PhD in toxicology, right?	33
3549	Should we also add forgetfulness?	33
3550	I have to tell my wife the truth.	33
3551	I just made you much, much worse.	33
3552	I feel like you don't respect me.	33
3553	I gave you a good recommendation.	33
3554	HPV was covered on the STD panel.	33
3555	I don't like owing people things.	33
3556	I don't see any bleeding in here.	33
3557	I have polycystic kidney disease.	33
3558	I have the skills to help people.	33
3559	I just--I thought you were moody.	33
3560	I mean, what am I supposed to do?	33
3561	I need to DDx a patient with you.	33
3562	How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?	33
3563	I can't take care of him anymore.	33
3564	Hey, wha-- is that the infection?	33
3565	Got a problem with that, fire me.	33
3566	I ain't got a girlfriend in here.	33
3567	Especially since my husband died.	33
3568	Ew! Your neck looks really gross.	33
3569	Feel free to jump in at any time.	33
3570	Feels like I'm missing something.	33
3571	Fungal infection's off the table.	33
3572	Have Chase start him on steroids.	33
3573	He also spiked a fever overnight.	33
3574	He said the work's been paid for.	33
3575	He'd want to get out of the wind.	33
3576	Her heart can't support dialysis.	33
3577	He's--he's repeating, blue shack.	33
3578	He's having an allergic reaction.	33
3579	Bunch of his high school buddies.	33
3580	'Cause he couldn't hear properly.	33
3581	Class-four hemorrhoids, like him.	33
3582	Calcium channel blocker to treat.	33
3583	Early onset familial Alzheimer's.	33
3584	EKG and troponins were equivocal.	33
3585	Don't want to explain this twice.	33
3586	Could be wrong about the symptom.	33
3587	Come on, just a little more time.	33
3588	Did you get beaten up on purpose?	33
3589	And Chase being cagey in general.	33
3590	And check Chase for testosterone.	33
3591	And he's always self-destructive.	33
3592	And how exactly is that my fault?	33
3593	And men love commitment-free sex.	33
3594	And the pericardial inflammation.	33
3595	Absolutely essential information.	33
3596	100 bucks says I won't get fired.	33
3597	All right, now go to work, House.	33
3598	Are you sorry about what you did?	33
3599	Autonomic dysregulation syndrome.	33
3600	And we're walking, we're walking.	33
3601	And you know him as well as I do.	33
3602	And you'll never get her consent.	33
3603	Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.	33
3604	Because they don't cost anything.	33
3605	Are you gonna punish callousness?	33
3606	Although, to be fair, I am large.	33
3607	We're in the middle of something.	33
3608	We're still working on the lungs.	33
3609	We've brought people's kids back.	33
3610	We've talked about it a lot, and.	33
3611	We--went bankrupt five years ago.	33
3612	We also probably ruined his life.	33
3613	We got him breathing, but barely.	33
3614	We needed a treatment that was a.	33
3615	We ruled that out three days ago.	33
3616	We'll continue with the medicine.	33
3617	What the hell are you doing here?	33
3618	What the hell is happening to me?	33
3619	What's the action on the ex-wife?	33
3620	Why exactly is that good for you?	33
3621	When did the discoloration start?	33
3622	Whereas you just dabble in crazy.	33
3623	Which apparently really bugs you.	33
3624	Which is great, most of the time.	33
3625	which you might have, by the way.	33
3626	That's when you started to excel.	33
3627	That's why we're taking the case?	33
3628	The classes make him sympathetic.	33
3629	The closest I got was Waimea Bay.	33
3630	The lies she must be telling him.	33
3631	The X-ray didn't show any tumors.	33
3632	That is nothing to be ashamed of.	33
3633	To put it another way, a patriot.	33
3634	Tracin' faces I'm craving nachos.	33
3635	Unless you want your own hearing.	33
3636	There's gotta be a deeper reason.	33
3637	There's no need to put him under.	33
3638	There's only one way to find out.	33
3639	These guys have got that covered.	33
3640	They stuck me in catholic school.	33
3641	They'll lie, because if you knew.	33
3642	This is gonna make me very happy.	33
3643	This is just you haggling, right?	33
3644	This patient died five years ago.	33
3645	Those flowers are from last week.	33
3646	Those who can't teach, teach gym.	33
3647	You're not getting enough oxygen.	33
3648	You're in the medical profession?	33
3649	You're the one everyone dislikes.	33
3650	Yes, I was on call for neurology.	33
3651	Your mom didn't hit you, did she?	33
3652	You could get more time with him.	33
3653	You manipulated me into doing it.	33
3654	You miss, never mention it again.	33
3655	You said the game wasn't typical.	33
3656	You talk to her, the bet is void.	33
3657	You told me it was okay to leave.	33
3658	You wanna get back at these guys.	33
3659	It's a valid sexual orientation.	32
3660	It's at my stepdad's law office.	32
3661	It's happened to me a few times.	32
3662	Iris! How do you know I'm lying?	32
3663	I'm still high in the esophagus.	32
3664	It can also just be dehydration.	32
3665	It could be a bladder infection.	32
3666	Liver function has improved 30%.	32
3667	Kind of like Stockholm syndrome.	32
3668	More deserving than anyone else?	32
3669	It's probably from my seat belt.	32
3670	I've only been in here one week.	32
3671	Just came here to say thank you.	32
3672	It was a team-building exercise.	32
3673	It'd take a half hour to set up.	32
3674	I was just getting to that part.	32
3675	I'm doing it to help my patient.	32
3676	I'm gonna need to see some tuna.	32
3677	I'm late for work in the clinic.	32
3678	I'm not a doctor anymore, House.	32
3679	I think you should get a biopsy.	32
3680	I thought we'd gotten past that.	32
3681	I thought you don't like favors.	32
3682	Nothing's wrong with having fun.	32
3683	Park's hearing's about to start.	32
3684	No signs of ulcers or blockages.	32
3685	No, I-- if you disagree with Dr.	32
3686	Mr.Chips looks like he wants it.	32
3687	MRI confirmed macroprolactinoma.	32
3688	Must be bleeding into his lungs.	32
3689	Not once I call Social Services.	32
3690	Not sure the amount is relevant.	32
3691	Nobody's here to bust you, iris.	32
3692	Never mind Bride of the Monster.	32
3693	Most likely meds will be enough.	32
3694	So you're saying I got the clap?	32
3695	So maybe a solvent or detergent?	32
3696	Test shows she's still pregnant.	32
3697	Racing heart: Medical condition.	32
3698	Probably got a kit stashed here.	32
3699	Probably just got sick of lying.	32
3700	She can barely catch her breath.	32
3701	Shut up, you lying sack of crap.	32
3702	I just don't have the resources.	32
3703	I just started back on the team.	32
3704	I just take vitamin C sometimes.	32
3705	I don't see creed, color, pulse.	32
3706	I don't see how that's possible.	32
3707	I don't think he's a psych case.	32
3708	I met a TV producer at a dinner.	32
3709	How many more tricks do you got?	32
3710	How the hell did I not see that?	32
3711	How could you keep this from me?	32
3712	Hey, keep your hands off my son.	32
3713	I don't know if I'm coming back.	32
3714	I did the same thing many times.	32
3715	Fine enough to get back to work?	32
3716	Fine motor control is improving.	32
3717	Hail, hail, the gang's all here.	32
3718	He also wants us to spy for him.	32
3719	He can't keep them at his place.	32
3720	He doesn't have photic epilepsy.	32
3721	He hasn't asked me for anything.	32
3722	Heard your arm's healing nicely.	32
3723	Go a little bit more along here.	32
3724	Hey! Is this supposed to happen?	32
3725	He's actually in here right now.	32
3726	He's confident in the diagnosis.	32
3727	He's down in the E.R. right now.	32
3728	He's got no reason to lie to me.	32
3729	But a shotgun is not gonna work.	32
3730	But ability isn't always enough.	32
3731	But not his swollen lymph notes.	32
3732	But you know what the rules are.	32
3733	'Cause I'm right here, you dick.	32
3734	Chances are he's done it before.	32
3735	Emergency page takes precedence.	32
3736	Could you just lower your voice?	32
3737	Did you give him sidewalk chalk?	32
3738	Do you know what sound he makes?	32
3739	Do you think I'm making this up?	32
3740	Does that mean you also have it?	32
3741	does this look like a good time?	32
3742	And I barely even have $100 and.	32
3743	Acute onset points to tularemia.	32
3744	Are you really leaving medicine?	32
3745	And those were your exact words?	32
3746	Blood work was negative for HIV.	32
3747	Because he was having headaches?	32
3748	We're testing for iron overload.	32
3749	We are veering wildly off track.	32
3750	We can go through this together.	32
3751	We don't call, she doesn't bolt.	32
3752	We have a reasoned disagreement.	32
3753	We thought it was the salt pork.	32
3754	We were together the whole time.	32
3755	What did your parents do to you?	32
3756	What are you guys talking about?	32
3757	What did he do when he was here?	32
3758	We'll let you know what we find.	32
3759	We're consulting with Neurology.	32
3760	What if she got it from her mom?	32
3761	What if the chicken was the egg?	32
3762	What round of chelation is this?	32
3763	What were you doing before this?	32
3764	Whatever's gonna get him better.	32
3765	Why don't you take preventative?	32
3766	When I was your age, I ran away.	32
3767	Wherever my chewing muscles are.	32
3768	The bleeder's got to be in here.	32
3769	The bleeding stopped on its own.	32
3770	The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.	32
3771	The guy was going downhill fast.	32
3772	Then it's a good thing he has A.	32
3773	Then we'll know what set it off.	32
3774	That falls under natural causes.	32
3775	That I can get out of here soon.	32
3776	That is six miles out of my way.	32
3777	That seems like an overreaction.	32
3778	Transesophageal echo to confirm.	32
3779	The patient will punch his wife.	32
3780	There's just wet gum under here.	32
3781	There's no way that I'm letting.	32
3782	They did a lateral view as well.	32
3783	This chair will help me do that.	32
3784	This hearing isn't about me, Dr.	32
3785	This is where you say thank you.	32
3786	This isn't necessarily paranoia.	32
3787	You're not gonna operate on her.	32
3788	You're clearly getting squeezed.	32
3789	You're doing it to protect them.	32
3790	Yes, Jarisch-herxheimer is real.	32
3791	You're also addicted to puzzles.	32
3792	Would explain the lack of fever.	32
3793	Would have seen meningial signs.	32
3794	Yeah, and then he got her drunk.	32
3795	Yeah, not one of my best people.	32
3796	You can't take the money, House.	32
3797	You claim you're not screwed up.	32
3798	You don't own anything you need.	32
3799	You have to go see him yourself.	32
3800	You say pressure, I say inspire.	32
3801	It's just a benign fat deposit.	31
3802	It's not an admission of guilt.	31
3803	Infection was right, after all.	31
3804	I'm talking about your breasts.	31
3805	Is that why you wanna be a nun?	31
3806	Look, my girl's more important.	31
3807	Masto's usually a skin disease.	31
3808	More than one, and you haven't.	31
3809	Lawyers say I'm not allowed to.	31
3810	Let's try the medication first.	31
3811	It's what I'd do if I were him.	31
3812	It's your first day back-- See?	31
3813	Just enough to spoil your kids?	31
3814	Just gonna put this right here.	31
3815	It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.	31
3816	It wasn't exactly an explosion.	31
3817	It works out well for everyone.	31
3818	It--it doesn't even make sense.	31
3819	I'm here for the free flu shot.	31
3820	I'm not looking for excitement.	31
3821	I think it's Whipple's disease.	31
3822	I shouldn't have lied about it.	31
3823	Patient got tachycardic to 185.	31
3824	No ability to answer questions.	31
3825	No one's ever proved it exists.	31
3826	My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.	31
3827	Name should've been a giveaway.	31
3828	Moving on to the G.E. junction.	31
3829	So much for genetics mattering.	31
3830	So a guy gives everything Sane.	31
3831	Sticking around the whole time?	31
3832	Ran a complete physical on her.	31
3833	Prep a room for an embolectomy.	31
3834	Prep the O.R. and get a gurney.	31
3835	She can't feel her foot at all.	31
3836	She's not your girl, you idiot.	31
3837	I just got the Ed Wood box set.	31
3838	I hate it when people say that.	31
3839	I have a department to re-fund.	31
3840	I have a patient who's asexual.	31
3841	I get four, and I give you two.	31
3842	I got to get out of here, okay?	31
3843	I don't think it was his fault.	31
3844	I have to find a place to live.	31
3845	I know you disagree with-- Dad.	31
3846	I need to talk to you and Phil.	31
3847	How much damage could you have?	31
3848	Highly insensitive for sarcoid.	31
3849	His body temperature is rising.	31
3850	His mental status is declining.	31
3851	House pulled it out of nowhere.	31
3852	I could feel better about that.	31
3853	Everywhere but a job interview.	31
3854	Found her sleeping in the park.	31
3855	He collapsed while out jogging.	31
3856	He has a nodule in his thyroid.	31
3857	He obviously noticed something.	31
3858	He thought that was stupid too.	31
3859	He trained for a marathon once.	31
3860	Girlfriend might not be so bad.	31
3861	He's as ready as he's gonna be.	31
3862	He's getting rid of everything.	31
3863	Bring her in and pack her nose.	31
3864	Busting a move in a night club.	31
3865	But you know that, which means.	31
3866	Clotting parameters are normal.	31
3867	Easier to pack in small crates.	31
3868	Dr.Foreman said you'd try this.	31
3869	Couldn't find my keys for days.	31
3870	depends upon the use of a team.	31
3871	Did I mention they come and go?	31
3872	Do you think people can change?	31
3873	And neither has the job, right?	31
3874	Almost always hits the kidneys.	31
3875	Almost dying's been clarifying.	31
3876	actually, why didn't I do that?	31
3877	And you want to take that away?	31
3878	Because I found someone I love?	31
3879	Because I'm just as bad as you.	31
3880	We've got another five minutes.	31
3881	What about the psychotic break?	31
3882	What about transverse myelitis?	31
3883	Well, that very evolved of you.	31
3884	Well, when you put it that way.	31
3885	Unlike you, I don't need drama.	31
3886	Unlimited Internet porn budget.	31
3887	Wasn't in the medicine cabinet.	31
3888	Watching them, not making them.	31
3889	We all have family dysfunction.	31
3890	We had to stop the transfusion.	31
3891	We need you to show us remorse.	31
3892	We still have a long way to go.	31
3893	Wear them while you masturbate?	31
3894	What do you-- what do you want?	31
3895	What exactly are you scared of?	31
3896	What kind did you have in mind?	31
3897	Where is the construction crew?	31
3898	Which means you proved nothing.	31
3899	Which means you're both idiots.	31
3900	Which provides a nice contrast.	31
3901	Who cares if House was callous?	31
3902	Who plays poker without cigars?	31
3903	The best dads wait two or more.	31
3904	The illness is alcohol-related.	31
3905	The joke gift, not the cocaine.	31
3906	Then I have to tell them first.	31
3907	Then there's nothing we can do.	31
3908	That didn't come up last night?	31
3909	Time to grow up and come clean.	31
3910	Told me to call him if you did.	31
3911	Took real good care of himself.	31
3912	There's blood in his urine bag.	31
3913	These are your training wheels.	31
3914	They don't even really know me.	31
3915	They had to be incredibly high.	31
3916	They'll track down the parents.	31
3917	They've given you a great home.	31
3918	You're not supposed to be here.	31
3919	You're apparently asymptomatic.	31
3920	Your heart rate is speeding up.	31
3921	You're a prisoner on tier time.	31
3922	Won't her chest pain come back?	31
3923	Yeah, well, I don't have a son.	31
3924	You don't remember your father.	31
3925	You got my parole form in here.	31
3926	You have to have the treatment.	31
3927	You owe me a new pair of pants.	31
3928	You sexually molested your son.	31
3929	You take very good care of him.	31
3930	You think I'm hitting on a nun?	31
3931	It's a tough thing to control.	30
3932	It's been years since he died.	30
3933	It's like Satan's alarm clock.	30
3934	It's not bad for a day's work.	30
3935	Interesting, but not relevant.	30
3936	It could destroy his identity.	30
3937	It's not worth living in fear.	30
3938	Knight to King's Bishop three.	30
3939	Lots of people don't have sex.	30
3940	Maybe if everybody didn't lie.	30
3941	Maybe we should ask your wife.	30
3942	Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.	30
3943	Let me start with an allegory.	30
3944	Just trying to understand you.	30
3945	It's the stench of moralizing.	30
3946	IV immunosuppressant to treat.	30
3947	I've been gaining more weight.	30
3948	Just drive me to the hospital.	30
3949	It just isn't worth it, House.	30
3950	It makes you a healthy person.	30
3951	It was good enough for my dad.	30
3952	It's a good thing that worked.	30
3953	I was trying to use the phone.	30
3954	I'm enjoying our conversation.	30
3955	I'm not loaning my boss money.	30
3956	I'm seeing a trauma counselor.	30
3957	If I wanted you to be like me.	30
3958	If it saves a life, who cares?	30
3959	I think it's just dehydration.	30
3960	I visit her grave once a week.	30
3961	Nowhere near enough vitamin A.	30
3962	One of the sensors came loose.	30
3963	Now, let's get this over with.	30
3964	Otherwise, I'd still be lying.	30
3965	Patient's a smart businessman.	30
3966	No, he thinks they're crucial.	30
3967	No, I wasn't being rhetorical.	30
3968	My kids loved the massage bed.	30
3969	My old man got diabetes at 50.	30
3970	My older brother got it at 50.	30
3971	Multiple warm lavage is safer.	30
3972	No, that's serious contraband.	30
3973	So I for sure got lung cancer?	30
3974	Saline flow is down to 10 ccs.	30
3975	Start treatment with steroids.	30
3976	See, that would be an example.	30
3977	Remember we talked about this?	30
3978	Our patient doesn't own a gun.	30
3979	Paraneoplastic syndrome's out.	30
3980	Praise for them springing Dad.	30
3981	She passed with flying colors.	30
3982	She was next up in the clinic.	30
3983	I found stains on his clothes.	30
3984	I saved her from brain damage.	30
3985	I know that sounds weird, but.	30
3986	I like their oranges and lint.	30
3987	I need a few minutes to think.	30
3988	I need to justify buying them.	30
3989	I need you to stop calling me.	30
3990	How the hell did we miss that?	30
3991	House's part, don't you think?	30
3992	How can you be okay with this?	30
3993	His assistant's name is Angie.	30
3994	His liver was in shock before.	30
3995	I can't believe I have cancer.	30
3996	I don't have to cough as much.	30
3997	I cut a deal with the patient.	30
3998	Ethics are not my strong suit.	30
3999	Foreman's not gonna back down.	30
4000	First patriotism, now loyalty.	30
4001	Following your brain is tough.	30
4002	Happily married for ten years.	30
4003	He can walk out of here cured.	30
4004	He couldn't find a babysitter.	30
4005	Give him an E.E.G. to confirm.	30
4006	Give me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.	30
4007	giving something to relax her.	30
4008	Getting along with her mother?	30
4009	Gotcha! You poor dumb bastard.	30
4010	Here's the per diem schedules.	30
4011	He's allergic to summer lilac.	30
4012	He's annoying, he's maddening.	30
4013	He's been alone all this time.	30
4014	He's late for a trashcan fire.	30
4015	Bunch of failed relationships.	30
4016	But I hadn't had sex in years.	30
4017	'Cause it's an anxiety attack.	30
4018	Coke never got past the lungs.	30
4019	Enjoy what time you have left.	30
4020	Could be polyarteritis nodosa.	30
4021	Could be thyrotoxic paralysis.	30
4022	Could have kidney involvement.	30
4023	Definitionally, that involves.	30
4024	Did you have surgery recently?	30
4025	Did you mention what happened?	30
4026	And he told me I should leave.	30
4027	And it only has 12 hours left.	30
4028	And maybe starting to go away.	30
4029	And mother is an abbreviation.	30
4030	A few hours ago you were sure.	30
4031	17-ketosteroid levels are low.	30
4032	After mom, I had nothing left.	30
4033	Assumed you have a huge penis?	30
4034	And they were, in fact, twins.	30
4035	Because he said he apologized?	30
4036	Because you had lousy parents.	30
4037	Are you calling his liver fat?	30
4038	Vitamin K deficiency's a bust.	30
4039	We didn't do a lot of talking.	30
4040	We still get to do crazy crap?	30
4041	What if it wasn't an accident?	30
4042	Why would you say any of that?	30
4043	Why would you want to do that?	30
4044	Why don't you stay here toght?	30
4045	Where did you unload the baby?	30
4046	The police have been notified.	30
4047	The prodigal son has returned.	30
4048	The world does that sometimes.	30
4049	There are two types of people.	30
4050	That unexpected things happen.	30
4051	There will be some discomfort.	30
4052	There's nothing profound here.	30
4053	There's nothing to talk about.	30
4054	They give out four a day, Max.	30
4055	This could be all psychiatric.	30
4056	This is a little scary for me.	30
4057	This is an ultrasound machine.	30
4058	This is outlandishly childish.	30
4059	You've got two choices, House.	30
4060	You're not gonna believe this.	30
4061	Will the endoscopy be painful?	30
4062	Yes, as a parent, I empathize.	30
4063	Yes, we knew what kawah meant.	30
4064	Your heart's beating too fast.	30
4065	Your mom and stepdad love you.	30
4066	Would have seen it on the MRI.	30
4067	Wouldn't cause hallucinations.	30
4068	Yeah, but he didn't know that.	30
4069	Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.	30
4070	Yeah, I think I read that too.	30
4071	Yeah, rats, mice, cockroaches.	30
4072	You brazenly defied your boss.	30
4073	You can't argue away my faith.	30
4074	You ever heard of dark matter?	30
4075	You feel guilty about leaving.	30
4076	You got her the job interview.	30
4077	You got the ending you wanted.	30
4078	You gotta go back to medicine.	30
4079	You have a LoJack on your leg.	30
4080	You just saw him this morning.	30
4081	You know he regained movement.	30
4082	You love all that caring crap.	30
4083	You mean all of us or just us?	30
4084	You refuse to bet on yourself.	30
4085	You should've told me earlier.	30
4086	You tell me which one's worse.	30
4087	You the guy, the kidney donor?	30
4088	You were making it up to them.	30
4089	It's all about common ground.	29
4090	It's all bought and paid for.	29
4091	It's brighter in the morning.	29
4092	It's normal to be screwed up.	29
4093	It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.	29
4094	In fact, I even encourage it.	29
4095	I'm staining for excess iron.	29
4096	I'm the one who did the test.	29
4097	I'm thinking-- you all right?	29
4098	Is that how our system works?	29
4099	is this really about a woman?	29
4100	It amounts to the same thing.	29
4101	Is she a giant pool of algae?	29
4102	I'm sorry I led House to you.	29
4103	Maybe he got bit by a spider.	29
4104	Maybe we're just out of time.	29
4105	Let me worry about logistics.	29
4106	It's uncomfortable, isn't it?	29
4107	James Wilson, county coroner.	29
4108	Jobs are not being destroyed.	29
4109	It's a little more than like.	29
4110	I'll go check on the patient.	29
4111	I'll try the marrow registry.	29
4112	I'm going with my girlfriend.	29
4113	I'm gonna let him be a donor.	29
4114	I'm gonna need a continuance.	29
4115	I'm short on cash this month.	29
4116	I-I checked online, and it's.	29
4117	I'd say giant cell arteritis.	29
4118	I think I need a bigger dose.	29
4119	Or maybe the reverse is true.	29
4120	Oscar, I gotta call you back.	29
4121	Patient probably has long QT.	29
4122	Picks up her new kid at 4:15.	29
4123	Pissing contest with Foreman.	29
4124	Plays to my strengths anyway.	29
4125	No! Wegener's granulomatosis.	29
4126	No, I got everything in need.	29
4127	No, I think I got palliative.	29
4128	My patient has a new symptom.	29
4129	Multiple birds, single stone.	29
4130	My aunt had one just like it.	29
4131	Not everything has an agenda.	29
4132	Not for the Dean of Medicine.	29
4133	Not worth more than my honor.	29
4134	Negative chest X-rays aren't.	29
4135	So you treated with steroids.	29
4136	So your testimony is that Dr.	29
4137	So I made a terrible mistake.	29
4138	So many children of your own.	29
4139	So we're back to square none?	29
4140	Screwed up is your best case.	29
4141	See what a tough spot I'm in?	29
4142	Steve loved all that-- Sorry.	29
4143	Plenty of time to make money.	29
4144	Plus the ten I got on margin.	29
4145	Probably from the diaper bag.	29
4146	Queen to King's Bishop seven.	29
4147	She doesn't wanna talk to me.	29
4148	She's perfectly fine-looking.	29
4149	Shouldn't have said anything.	29
4150	I have to live with this too.	29
4151	I have to send him to prison.	29
4152	I heard you're on short time.	29
4153	I just can't do this anymore.	29
4154	I just don't know what to do.	29
4155	I felt God's love, his grace.	29
4156	I got friends on the outside.	29
4157	I don't think he can take it.	29
4158	I killed my business partner.	29
4159	I know he's talked about you.	29
4160	I live next to a Jewish frat.	29
4161	House is obviously brilliant.	29
4162	I can't believe you did that.	29
4163	Even if it was based on lies.	29
4164	Fall in love, wanna be happy.	29
4165	Freak out is a little strong.	29
4166	First admit that I was right.	29
4167	Following your heart is easy.	29
4168	He already said I was an ass.	29
4169	He may die from those wounds.	29
4170	Get out of my House, Stomper.	29
4171	Get out of my office, please.	29
4172	Hey, heading out to the yard?	29
4173	Good to see you on your feet.	29
4174	He's gone from ally to enemy.	29
4175	He's got everything he needs.	29
4176	But delightful, all the same.	29
4177	But if it'll get me the file.	29
4178	But it's related to medicine.	29
4179	But that's only experimental.	29
4180	Can't be, bilirubin's normal.	29
4181	Cassock made my ass look fat.	29
4182	'Cause I'm firing her myself.	29
4183	Check out our new brand, huh?	29
4184	Chelation is making it worse.	29
4185	Chips 5 bucks to take a dive.	29
4186	Coma had to be a lucky guess.	29
4187	Can we talk about my patient?	29
4188	Dad, what are you doing here?	29
4189	coronary arteries were clean.	29
4190	Can you raise both your arms?	29
4191	Commitment's not conditional.	29
4192	Disseminated T-cell lymphoma.	29
4193	Do anything different lately?	29
4194	Don't forget the thumbscrews.	29
4195	And that you were the reason.	29
4196	And the tox screen was clean.	29
4197	All those knives and needles.	29
4198	As long as we find something.	29
4199	Aspirin in adults is a reach.	29
4200	And your collective vomiting.	29
4201	Boredom is not transmissible.	29
4202	Being a live donor has risks.	29
4203	because it's not that strong.	29
4204	Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.	29
4205	Well, then what's this, then?	29
4206	Well, what about the patient?	29
4207	Vomiting stopped after the E.	29
4208	Unlike you stealing my phone.	29
4209	Wants treatment for diabetes.	29
4210	Was he sensitive to sunlight?	29
4211	We all disagree all the time.	29
4212	We do not provide child care.	29
4213	We just need a drop of blood.	29
4214	We only help rich white guys?	29
4215	We really gotta get you laid.	29
4216	We thought the case was over.	29
4217	We were just looking for you.	29
4218	What do I need to do for you?	29
4219	What else is she gonna think?	29
4220	What if she was misdiagnosed?	29
4221	What the hell does that mean?	29
4222	What's that I smell, friiend?	29
4223	Why would you lie about that?	29
4224	Why did you ignore that risk?	29
4225	What's wrong with my stomach?	29
4226	What's your patient's status?	29
4227	The girl I was seeing wasn't.	29
4228	The problem isn't his marrow.	29
4229	Then he's not allergic to it.	29
4230	That bloodwork is week's old.	29
4231	That'll teach me to overbill.	29
4232	Take her off the Ceftriaxone.	29
4233	There's a neurological issue.	29
4234	These abrasions on his knees.	29
4235	They're willing to come back.	29
4236	This is not an exact process.	29
4237	Three tests, three positives.	29
4238	You've been wrong every time.	29
4239	You've seen Spartacus, right?	29
4240	You're blaming the wrong guy.	29
4241	Will he miss a lot of school?	29
4242	Will you please just go away?	29
4243	Yes, completely unacceptable.	29
4244	Your daughter has ascariasis.	29
4245	Your hair smelled like Adams.	29
4246	Your mom knows she messed up.	29
4247	Wilson said it wasn't cancer.	29
4248	Won't even trust a co-worker.	29
4249	Works at an American factory.	29
4250	Wrinkle pattern's too varied.	29
4251	Yeah, but not for protection.	29
4252	Yeah, I use booze as payment.	29
4253	You can't leave the hospital.	29
4254	You can't, and neither can I.	29
4255	You didn't have a bad lawyer.	29
4256	You didn't just burn bridges.	29
4257	You do that on your own time.	29
4258	You don't know that you will.	29
4259	You don't look like a Mariel.	29
4260	you double your clinic hours.	29
4261	You envied their dysfunction?	29
4262	You had no right to say that.	29
4263	You have a bad case of irony.	29
4264	You have a brain tumor, okay?	29
4265	You have them DNA tested yet?	29
4266	You know what sound he makes?	29
4267	You know, I'm a little tired.	29
4268	You need to keep up your rep.	29
4269	You set the wheels in motion.	29
4270	I'm betting on the last one.	28
4271	It's going to be okay, baby.	28
4272	It's like it wasn't even me.	28
4273	Imperio absenti chaos regit.	28
4274	I'm still gonna-- Keep less?	28
4275	I'm still on temporary vows.	28
4276	It's nothing I can't handle.	28
4277	Looks like we're both wrong.	28
4278	Let's get out of here first.	28
4279	Like he loves our kids more.	28
4280	It's the best thing for him.	28
4281	I've already got a religion.	28
4282	It was a moment of weakness.	28
4283	It wasn't caused by a v-fib.	28
4284	It's a little late for that.	28
4285	I'll look for toxins myself.	28
4286	I'm consulting on this case.	28
4287	I'm feeling much better now.	28
4288	I'm protecting my diagnosis.	28
4289	If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.	28
4290	I think maybe you should go.	28
4291	I thought it'd be different.	28
4292	I spent a month in solitary.	28
4293	I told my husband about you.	28
4294	I took that scalpel for you.	28
4295	I wanted you to feel better.	28
4296	Obviously you're Australian.	28
4297	Oh! There is one more thing.	28
4298	Not a fan of guns I take it.	28
4299	Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and.	28
4300	Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy.	28
4301	Nah, that's not gonna do it.	28
4302	Most good doctors are weird.	28
4303	Sri Lankan Independence Day.	28
4304	Start him on blood thinners.	28
4305	Start him on plasmapheresis.	28
4306	Something will turn up soon.	28
4307	some things come into focus.	28
4308	Somebody call an ambulance! 	28
4309	Reye's in adults is a reach.	28
4310	She doesn't want to see him.	28
4311	She needs a transplant, but.	28
4312	She's leading with her chin.	28
4313	I hope it works out for you.	28
4314	I got sciatica, like my dad.	28
4315	I know what killed your son.	28
4316	I made it look like suicide.	28
4317	I need help with my patient.	28
4318	How do you know she's happy?	28
4319	How does your ex-wife do it?	28
4320	His heart should start soon.	28
4321	His symptoms have gone away.	28
4322	Every time I see her, I say.	28
4323	Funduscopic exam was normal.	28
4324	First cousin's also a whiff.	28
4325	He also has a low red count.	28
4326	He asked for a personal day.	28
4327	Give the kids a kiss for me.	28
4328	Got some new girly mags too.	28
4329	He's doing his clinic hours.	28
4330	He's fighting for his honor.	28
4331	He's had his eyebrows waxed.	28
4332	He's moving it out of grief.	28
4333	He's not immuno-compromised.	28
4334	BP just went to 140 over 90.	28
4335	But I need to ask you favor.	28
4336	But maybe the old paint did.	28
4337	But this mold definitely is.	28
4338	'Cause I can't feel my legs.	28
4339	'Cause I could knock her up.	28
4340	'Cause I'm vain and shallow.	28
4341	'Cause it's gonna end badly.	28
4342	Circle of Willis also clear.	28
4343	Can it cause hallucinations?	28
4344	Eastern equine encephalitis?	28
4345	Either a hot tub or a sauna.	28
4346	Draw up a little anesthetic.	28
4347	Could that have caused this?	28
4348	Could you guys keep it down?	28
4349	Did House give you homework?	28
4350	Did Taub put you up to this?	28
4351	And 3 times 2 times 2 is 12.	28
4352	Alcohol-induced esophagitis.	28
4353	And you said the Devils won?	28
4354	Based on his yellow fingers.	28
4355	Bad things sometimes happen.	28
4356	What about pheochromocytoma?	28
4357	What are you doing with her?	28
4358	Well, maybe Adams was right.	28
4359	Use cross-matched platelets.	28
4360	Waiting for me at the table.	28
4361	We can't take it personally.	28
4362	We disproved his asexuality.	28
4363	We need racemic epinephrine.	28
4364	We went a clinic in Trenton.	28
4365	What did the endoscopy show?	28
4366	What are you planning to do?	28
4367	We're going to the cath lab?	28
4368	What the hell are you doing?	28
4369	What happened to your cheek?	28
4370	Why aren't you more alarmed?	28
4371	Why didn't you ever tell me?	28
4372	Which proves she's an idiot.	28
4373	That's why we're successful.	28
4374	The donor had hemosiderosis.	28
4375	The medical term is cankles.	28
4376	Then why are you doing this?	28
4377	Then why isn't he saturated?	28
4378	Then why'd you lie about it?	28
4379	That blood looks pretty dry.	28
4380	to give it to the same lady?	28
4381	Turn to an inch to the left.	28
4382	There's no treatment for it.	28
4383	There's subtle eyebrow loss.	28
4384	They expect a full recovery.	28
4385	They missed your son's rash.	28
4386	This bet's got to be a test.	28
4387	This doesn't make any sense.	28
4388	This is completely my fault.	28
4389	This is why you get married.	28
4390	This is working fine for me.	28
4391	You've got to be kidding me.	28
4392	You're not sure of his name?	28
4393	You're protecting this girl.	28
4394	You're letting in the flies.	28
4395	You're thinking lung cancer.	28
4396	Yes, and-- and then you die.	28
4397	You'd have to hire me first.	28
4398	You'll figure something out.	28
4399	Your judgment's compromised.	28
4400	You're a moron and a coward.	28
4401	Wow, 127 quarterback rating.	28
4402	You are making minimum wage.	28
4403	You asking me out on a date?	28
4404	You care that I lied to you.	28
4405	You ever hear of Kongo Gumi?	28
4406	You felt oxygen depravation.	28
4407	You handle him and his wife.	28
4408	You need to hang on to that.	28
4409	You need to leave him alone.	28
4410	You need to watch Norma Rae.	28
4411	You slept with your patient?	28
4412	You still have an hour left.	28
4413	You think I did this to him?	28
4414	You want me to return these?	28
4415	You want to go back to jail.	28
4416	You were right about Nicole.	28
4417	It's a tale as old as time.	27
4418	Iris isn't sexually active.	27
4419	I'm still sending him back.	27
4420	I got to--I got to get out.	27
4421	May I ask why that matters?	27
4422	Maybe we should look again.	27
4423	Mom died after a few years.	27
4424	More risk, but more upside.	27
4425	Just making an observation.	27
4426	Just not a great influence.	27
4427	I've had dreams about this.	27
4428	Just feels heavy when I do.	27
4429	Just give him five aspirin.	27
4430	It produces excess hormone.	27
4431	It started with card games.	27
4432	It was aerosolized Heparin.	27
4433	It was my fault daddy died.	27
4434	I was sick of living a lie.	27
4435	I was stabbed by a patient.	27
4436	I'm guessing ankle monitor.	27
4437	I'm just playing solitaire.	27
4438	I'm not coming back, House.	27
4439	I'm not doing this for you.	27
4440	I think the ledger's clear.	27
4441	I spent the night with her.	27
4442	I talked to Chase and Taub.	27
4443	I th--I think I'm gonna go.	27
4444	I think he said exoplanets.	27
4445	I won't tell them anything.	27
4446	Oh, you don't wanna bet me.	27
4447	Oh, now I just want to win.	27
4448	On short time, tax goes up.	27
4449	Oh, everything has changed.	27
4450	Now is not the time, Bobby.	27
4451	Opening a birthday present.	27
4452	Or something she's wearing.	27
4453	Or the neighbor's hot wife.	27
4454	Pinto stat to the cath lab.	27
4455	No metabolic or structural.	27
4456	no one's unhappy in Greece.	27
4457	No! Your lips are swelling.	27
4458	Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee.	27
4459	None of this is fun, House.	27
4460	M-make me want to have sex?	27
4461	My, uh, my eye feels weird.	27
4462	So your daughter was wrong.	27
4463	So I really have no choice.	27
4464	Sickness and health, right?	27
4465	Sorry to show up like this.	27
4466	really need a lot of money.	27
4467	I heard the nurses talking.	27
4468	I guess my minimum is just.	27
4469	I had a whole life planned.	27
4470	I have had second thoughts.	27
4471	I left because of his eyes.	27
4472	I need to examine your son.	27
4473	How about a viral syndrome?	27
4474	How can he be hyper-sexual?	27
4475	His trachea wasn't swollen.	27
4476	House is screwing with you.	27
4477	House, House, just stop it.	27
4478	I can't move my arm or leg.	27
4479	I can't take my finger out.	27
4480	I almost died in that cell.	27
4481	I already lost one of them.	27
4482	I always wanted to believe.	27
4483	I could do a clotting test.	27
4484	Everything's shutting down.	27
4485	Factor 5 Leiden deficiency.	27
4486	Fits his physical symptoms.	27
4487	He doesn't have joint pain.	27
4488	He played awesome as usual.	27
4489	He saved my husband's life.	27
4490	He used to call him deezer.	27
4491	He was sitting at his desk.	27
4492	He won't even need surgery.	27
4493	Get him an echo to confirm.	27
4494	Good things usually happen.	27
4495	But he makes us all better.	27
4496	But I can't live like this.	27
4497	But I've given up red meat.	27
4498	But reaction to meds could.	27
4499	But these things take time.	27
4500	But we have another option.	27
4501	But we'll get through this.	27
4502	Can't change what happened.	27
4503	Central serous retinopathy?	27
4504	Code Grey! Get haloperidol.	27
4505	Buys you whatever you need.	27
4506	Dull people get cancer too.	27
4507	Could be Coxsackie B virus.	27
4508	Could be hyperalimentation.	27
4509	Could be Zollinger-Ellison.	27
4510	Convent lets you have this?	27
4511	Did you just eat something?	27
4512	Do you remember being hurt?	27
4513	Doctors can be degenerates.	27
4514	Don't let House get to you.	27
4515	And I don't want your help.	27
4516	And it's still his company.	27
4517	And that's significant why?	27
4518	A few pills of Mebendazole.	27
4519	A stupid, horrible mistake.	27
4520	Aagh! He--he had on a what?	27
4521	Are you trying to annoy us?	27
4522	As soon as you leave, I am.	27
4523	Assuming I got lost, twice.	27
4524	At least I have principles.	27
4525	And this means a lot to me.	27
4526	And when did he learn that?	27
4527	Because you work for House.	27
4528	Anyone can screw up a life.	27
4529	Andrews predicted the coma.	27
4530	We're not having an affair.	27
4531	Were you high on that trip?	27
4532	Well, what's after respect?	27
4533	Virus, virus, virus, virus.	27
4534	We belong to the same club.	27
4535	We can't actually see them.	27
4536	We didn't find any poisons.	27
4537	We discussed it right here.	27
4538	We killed part of the lung.	27
4539	We need the nuclear option.	27
4540	We still can't rule it out.	27
4541	We still got to get it out.	27
4542	We tested him for syphilis.	27
4543	We'll run a pregnancy test.	27
4544	We're doing the tilt table.	27
4545	What would Cuddy have done?	27
4546	Why are you looking at her?	27
4547	What's your dentist's name?	27
4548	Where are you getting this?	27
4549	Which is good news for you.	27
4550	Which is sad and pertinent.	27
4551	Who is that, your roommate?	27
4552	That's what those guns are.	27
4553	That's why you're relieved.	27
4554	The bleeding is in her gut.	27
4555	The details are just gravy.	27
4556	The guy's potassium is off.	27
4557	The stink bomb was Chase's.	27
4558	The technical term is slow.	27
4559	Then find someone who does.	27
4560	Then why're you telling me?	27
4561	There are those eyes again.	27
4562	That means low self-esteem.	27
4563	That's a very moving story.	27
4564	Too late for your eyesight.	27
4565	Uh, I'll-- I'll be outside.	27
4566	Strong, emotional reaction.	27
4567	They should be dead by now.	27
4568	Things got a little heated.	27
4569	This guy went on walkabout.	27
4570	Three times two equals six.	27
4571	You're protecting the girl.	27
4572	You're gonna get us killed.	27
4573	Your colleague was stabbed.	27
4574	You're a bit late for that.	27
4575	Work in some boring office?	27
4576	Would it make a difference?	27
4577	You can cancel the hearing.	27
4578	You didn't have any priors.	27
4579	You didn't say that before.	27
4580	You have unlimited texting.	27
4581	You hit, you make the call.	27
4582	You just think they're fun.	27
4583	You need to check this out.	27
4584	You need to log more hours.	27
4585	You really haven't changed.	27
4586	You sound like my daughter.	27
4587	You sure you wanna do this?	27
4588	You think that's pertinent?	27
4589	You were a pretty big deal.	27
4590	It's a slow-growing tumor.	26
4591	It's been mildly elevated.	26
4592	It's extreme and reckless.	26
4593	It's not just me and Park.	26
4594	Increase the steroid dose.	26
4595	Is endocarditis treatable?	26
4596	I'm talking to this agent.	26
4597	Is that what he called it?	26
4598	It doesn't make any sense.	26
4599	Maybe it's your character.	26
4600	More to it than you think.	26
4601	It's up and running again.	26
4602	It's your perfect patient.	26
4603	I've heard he's a wiggler.	26
4604	Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.	26
4605	It looks very complicated.	26
4606	It means he's got a tumor.	26
4607	It was a two-for-one sale.	26
4608	It was like he forgave me.	26
4609	I'll run some blood tests.	26
4610	I'll start him on hematin.	26
4611	I'm not allergic to wheat.	26
4612	I'm out of here on Friday.	26
4613	I-I think House set me up.	26
4614	I thought it was relevant.	26
4615	I tell her it's vitamin C.	26
4616	I thought that was Nadine.	26
4617	I tried the outside world.	26
4618	I wouldn't worry about it.	26
4619	Oh, now you wanna help me.	26
4620	O.M.F.G. 50% off cupcakes.	26
4621	Now I have swollen ankles.	26
4622	Patient has low platelets.	26
4623	No enhancement on the MRI.	26
4624	No realization whatsoever.	26
4625	No! Get out of here! Wait.	26
4626	No, he's not my boyfriend.	26
4627	no, his biological father.	26
4628	No, I don't need a minute.	26
4629	My diagnostic test worked.	26
4630	Not by hiding myself away.	26
4631	Not when we were together.	26
4632	Not an irrational thought.	26
4633	No, this is me helping me.	26
4634	No, you wanna like boring.	26
4635	So can I get back to work?	26
4636	S.T.D. panel was negative.	26
4637	Same thing happened to me.	26
4638	Stop me whenever you like.	26
4639	Oh, no, wait-- that's her.	26
4640	Ready for the donor lungs.	26
4641	Sex drive is in the brain.	26
4642	She does have a boyfriend.	26
4643	She finishes work at 4:00.	26
4644	She just needed some time.	26
4645	She's feeling much better.	26
4646	She's lying to compensate.	26
4647	She's your road not taken.	26
4648	I have a massive migraine.	26
4649	I even did a complete MRI.	26
4650	How's he doing these days?	26
4651	How's the chelation going?	26
4652	I didn't hook them up yet.	26
4653	I didn't say it was wrong.	26
4654	I don't remember anything.	26
4655	I don't think she's lying.	26
4656	I mean, in the guest room.	26
4657	I missed you both so much.	26
4658	I need her out of my life.	26
4659	I object to your cynicism.	26
4660	How do we explain the STD?	26
4661	How old do you think I am?	26
4662	How'd the mom seem to you?	26
4663	Honey, I don't understand.	26
4664	Hormone levels are normal.	26
4665	House isn't gonna give up.	26
4666	House used to be a doctor.	26
4667	House, it's not a symptom.	26
4668	House, what are you doing?	26
4669	I brought it to your cell.	26
4670	I can get you out of here.	26
4671	I can't live in that home.	26
4672	I custom-built this puppy.	26
4673	Even has a metaphor in it.	26
4674	Everybody looked up to me.	26
4675	Everyone keeps their jobs.	26
4676	Family-owned and operated.	26
4677	Have never cheated on you.	26
4678	He has to be professional.	26
4679	He is an excellent doctor.	26
4680	He started vomiting again.	26
4681	Get me sutures on a Kelly.	26
4682	Give me the full $200,000.	26
4683	Gives us about 20 minutes.	26
4684	He's allergic to a person?	26
4685	He's allergic to chlorine?	26
4686	He's lying, not just Taub.	26
4687	Can't you see she's upset?	26
4688	'Cause nothing's happened.	26
4689	'Cause this expires today.	26
4690	Chase didn't listen to me.	26
4691	Check out the video again.	26
4692	Called you his China doll?	26
4693	By Mikhel for: Subtitulos.	26
4694	Easily we cry Now get out.	26
4695	Emory was a wonderful man.	26
4696	Dutch chocolate's not bad.	26
4697	Can you tell me your name?	26
4698	Congratulations, Dr.House.	26
4699	Do you hurt anywhere else?	26
4700	Do you think that's crazy?	26
4701	Doctor's right about that.	26
4702	An understandable mistake.	26
4703	And he was just the first.	26
4704	And I've been a lousy mom.	26
4705	And nothing seems to help.	26
4706	300 milligrams amiodarone.	26
4707	A couple of possibilities.	26
4708	A faint one, on his cheek.	26
4709	Aerosolized Heparin might.	26
4710	Again, why does it matter?	26
4711	As opposed to being right?	26
4712	At least he thinks he did.	26
4713	And there's your new team.	26
4714	And these ones were right.	26
4715	And they don't dislike me.	26
4716	Because it was so shallow.	26
4717	Apathetic hyperthyroidism.	26
4718	We're running out of time.	26
4719	What about a stick of gum?	26
4720	What about Fahr's disease?	26
4721	What about House's theory?	26
4722	What about the good stuff?	26
4723	What are you doing to him?	26
4724	Was there any money in it?	26
4725	We should call the police.	26
4726	What do you want us to do?	26
4727	We'll know in a few hours.	26
4728	What happened to your eye?	26
4729	when his seizure occurred.	26
4730	When they die or she dies.	26
4731	Where are the DNA results?	26
4732	white head of diagnostics.	26
4733	The affair with that girl.	26
4734	Then go back to neurology.	26
4735	That is a sign of concern.	26
4736	That's real mature, House.	26
4737	Tick borne disease season.	26
4738	Uh, it's nothing personal.	26
4739	Understand your confusion.	26
4740	There's a mass in the arm.	26
4741	They blew it, didn't they?	26
4742	Thought she just got here.	26
4743	You're nothing without me.	26
4744	You're scared, aren't you?	26
4745	Wife of the groundskeeper.	26
4746	Yes, but what's it called?	26
4747	You-- you don't scare her.	26
4748	You-- you understand them.	26
4749	Your car is getting fixed.	26
4750	Your life outside is over.	26
4751	You're allowed to go home.	26
4752	Would you read it, please?	26
4753	Yeah, well, not this time.	26
4754	You can even have it back.	26
4755	You can't let him do this.	26
4756	you cheated on your taxes?	26
4757	You do, and I'll prove it.	26
4758	You don't have to do that.	26
4759	You don't have to sign it.	26
4760	You have one lying around?	26
4761	You said you were married.	26
4762	You were right to push me.	26
4763	Myelodysplastic syndrome.	25
4764	I was at a job interview.	25
4765	I got to get out of here.	25
4766	It's a synthetic problem.	25
4767	It's actually pretty fun.	25
4768	It's different for girls.	25
4769	It's getting hard to see.	25
4770	It's just you have to go.	25
4771	It's no longer my choice.	25
4772	It's none of my business.	25
4773	It's not insider trading.	25
4774	I'm sure she understands.	25
4775	Is that fugliness weekly?	25
4776	It's not resolved, is it?	25
4777	Kids might be precocious.	25
4778	Maybe it won't be so bad.	25
4779	Maybe it's not stupidity.	25
4780	Just sitting and praying.	25
4781	Just so much and no more.	25
4782	It's tissue inflammation.	25
4783	It was coagulated plasma.	25
4784	It was great knowing you.	25
4785	It'll just take a minute.	25
4786	It's 3:30 in the morning.	25
4787	It's a medical diagnosis.	25
4788	It's a medical procedure.	25
4789	I was in prison, you see.	25
4790	I'll give you your money.	25
4791	I'll X-ray him on Friday.	25
4792	I'm gonna do the surgery.	25
4793	I'm not the bad guy here.	25
4794	I'm running PCR test now.	25
4795	I'm scared of everything.	25
4796	I trained to be a Doctor.	25
4797	I wanted to reassure you.	25
4798	Off at his other clinics.	25
4799	No one gave me a handout.	25
4800	No way not to mess it up.	25
4801	No, I meant, what was it?	25
4802	My job is to be the jerk.	25
4803	must be scary to be back.	25
4804	Middle third of the neck.	25
4805	No, then they might stop.	25
4806	No, they were stupid too.	25
4807	So why the shoulder pain?	25
4808	So you wanna research it?	25
4809	So I had Park follow you.	25
4810	So it's really over $100?	25
4811	See you tomorrow morning.	25
4812	Rubbing alcohol, vinegar.	25
4813	Tell him! Do the surgery.	25
4814	Temporal lobes are clear.	25
4815	Stevens-Johnson syndrome.	25
4816	Someone broke your heart.	25
4817	Points again to paranoia.	25
4818	Posterior cerebral clear.	25
4819	Pretty serious condition.	25
4820	Pulmonology was that way.	25
4821	Put the Vicodin away, Dr.	25
4822	She died a few hours ago.	25
4823	She has jaw claudication.	25
4824	She's overwhelmed enough.	25
4825	I guess that would be me.	25
4826	I hadn't thought of that.	25
4827	I don't trust you, House.	25
4828	I run a diagnostic trial.	25
4829	I should be on six a day.	25
4830	I like my nurses naughty.	25
4831	I mean, not-- not really.	25
4832	How about I help you out?	25
4833	His leg muscles are fine.	25
4834	House is not the problem.	25
4835	House longer than anyone.	25
4836	House, get away from him.	25
4837	I can't make you do that.	25
4838	Husband have her tonight?	25
4839	I don't blame either one.	25
4840	I don't have a boyfriend.	25
4841	Everybody makes mistakes.	25
4842	Everyone loves fireworks.	25
4843	Everything has gone blue.	25
4844	Find out what killed him.	25
4845	Frankly, I feel violated.	25
4846	For what I'm about to do.	25
4847	He always seemed so nice.	25
4848	He has one pair of pants.	25
4849	He has Plummer's disease.	25
4850	He really went after her.	25
4851	He walked right up to me.	25
4852	He wanted to check on me.	25
4853	He was not doing cocaine.	25
4854	He'd have localized pain.	25
4855	He'll wake up in an hour.	25
4856	Give me a hand with this.	25
4857	He's puking his guts out.	25
4858	Hey! Hey! Son of a bitch.	25
4859	Here's what I'm thinking.	25
4860	He's doing the treatment.	25
4861	He's got his office back.	25
4862	He's not gonna like this.	25
4863	He's not in the hospital.	25
4864	Both your kids are named.	25
4865	But the kid never smoked.	25
4866	Carotid duplex is normal.	25
4867	Cameras are ringside too.	25
4868	By Mikhel for Subtitulos.	25
4869	By not screwing with you.	25
4870	E.R. found nothing wrong.	25
4871	Embrace your inner bitch.	25
4872	Eosiniphilic pneumonitis.	25
4873	Drink it, don't drink it.	25
4874	Could be a latex allergy.	25
4875	Could you help with that?	25
4876	Cuddy's not here anymore.	25
4877	Definitely causes apathy.	25
4878	Do you like your dentist?	25
4879	doesn't take a boyfriend.	25
4880	And alkalinize his urine.	25
4881	And I think that's great.	25
4882	And it's not in the pool.	25
4883	And mom's a selfish jerk.	25
4884	All the money's on tumor.	25
4885	All kids, not just yours.	25
4886	Actually, it was my idea.	25
4887	Agh! Oh, that is too bad.	25
4888	Are you saying I'm crazy?	25
4889	And what about your idea?	25
4890	And what if I have a kid?	25
4891	Ben, you barely knew him.	25
4892	Because you're not dying.	25
4893	Any recent health issues?	25
4894	Also, I don't own a suit.	25
4895	Alzheimer's is different.	25
4896	We've got brain activity.	25
4897	We've got two young kids.	25
4898	We've just been assuming.	25
4899	What about the JBE virus?	25
4900	Ventricles are clear too.	25
4901	Ventricular fibrillation.	25
4902	Upper esophagus is clear.	25
4903	We don't have any choice.	25
4904	We need to hit it harder.	25
4905	We need to take a biopsy.	25
4906	Wait, you understand him?	25
4907	What are you testing for?	25
4908	Well, how do you do that?	25
4909	We're doing them a favor.	25
4910	Why would they thank him?	25
4911	When you're facing death.	25
4912	Which means he goes home.	25
4913	Who used to babysit Drew?	25
4914	That's why you were late.	25
4915	The antitoxin is working.	25
4916	The crew's just starting.	25
4917	The first pair were $120.	25
4918	The game started at 7:00.	25
4919	The math is pretty basic.	25
4920	The tox screen was clean.	25
4921	Then we've got to biopsy.	25
4922	That mass wasn't a tumor.	25
4923	That people don't change.	25
4924	That was the whole point.	25
4925	That wouldn't be related.	25
4926	That's already ruled out.	25
4927	That's completely normal.	25
4928	Transplant team ran an A.	25
4929	Treat her for alcoholism.	25
4930	Turns out we caused that.	25
4931	Uh, like five months ago.	25
4932	There was a problem, but.	25
4933	Thanks for all your help.	25
4934	There's no breath sounds.	25
4935	There's no calcification.	25
4936	These are ringside seats.	25
4937	They could've moved back.	25
4938	They just don't like you.	25
4939	This is your new reality.	25
4940	You've got nothing on me.	25
4941	You're not going to jail.	25
4942	You're lying, aren't you?	25
4943	What's with you and Park?	25
4944	You're going to Thailand.	25
4945	You're through the aorta.	25
4946	You're trying to deflect.	25
4947	you'll go back to prison.	25
4948	Your hands are trembling.	25
4949	Wilson needs these lungs.	25
4950	Would it hurt to do both?	25
4951	Yeah, I'll admit to that.	25
4952	You allergic to anything?	25
4953	You asking 'cause I surf?	25
4954	You do it through policy.	25
4955	You do whatever it takes.	25
4956	You don't do that unless.	25
4957	You don't get it, do you?	25
4958	You go right back to fun?	25
4959	You have a bit of a rash.	25
4960	You make her feel guilty.	25
4961	You never found a career.	25
4962	You screwed up the lungs.	25
4963	So who do you blame, Dr.	24
4964	It's an imperfect world.	24
4965	It's Kawasaki's Disease.	24
4966	It's my job description.	24
4967	Increasing to 100% FiO2.	24
4968	Is everything all right?	24
4969	Lock up on your way out.	24
4970	Look, he made a mistake.	24
4971	maybe get suspended and.	24
4972	Mom, dad, and mom's dad.	24
4973	Left lung is pinking up.	24
4974	Let me know how it goes.	24
4975	Let's see if this helps.	24
4976	Just two more questions.	24
4977	It's the same principle.	24
4978	Just don't interrupt me.	24
4979	It makes me work harder.	24
4980	It was a harmless prank.	24
4981	It was too an explosion.	24
4982	It wasn't a miscarriage.	24
4983	It's a pleural effusion.	24
4984	I'll get it at a clinic.	24
4985	I'll make you a counter.	24
4986	I'm going to that fight.	24
4987	I'm gonna go give him P.	24
4988	I'm gonna need that too.	24
4989	I'm just glad it's over.	24
4990	I'm not done testifying.	24
4991	I'm not gonna interfere.	24
4992	I'm not like you, House.	24
4993	I'm not taking the risk.	24
4994	I'd take you if I could.	24
4995	I think they were happy.	24
4996	I spoke to the prioress.	24
4997	I want and need parents.	24
4998	I will be once you just.	24
4999	I would strongly advise.	24
5000	Oh, I have to take this.	24
5001	Or it's just rich guilt.	24
5002	Ortho needed more space.	24
5003	Perhaps you can help us.	24
5004	Picking up dry cleaning.	24
5005	No sign of malnutrition.	24
5006	My patient signed a DNR.	24
5007	Not even at his funeral.	24
5008	Nothing is tamper-proof.	24
5009	No, paralysis was first.	24
5010	So glad you're on board.	24
5011	Saving one life is good.	24
5012	Root canal and Berger's.	24
5013	Smile and say thank you.	24
5014	Test came back positive.	24
5015	Sounds like a good plan.	24
5016	Start him on antivirals.	24
5017	Start him on Interferon.	24
5018	Stay out of my business.	24
5019	See, the metaphors work.	24
5020	Societies do fall apart.	24
5021	Release the best actors?	24
5022	Right middle lobe isn't.	24
5023	She couldn't keep a job.	24
5024	She has a job interview.	24
5025	She left because of you.	24
5026	She's not yours to fire.	24
5027	I hope it went terribly.	24
5028	I feel like I'm in hell.	24
5029	I have to get to my car.	24
5030	I know about exit taxes.	24
5031	I know it feels strange.	24
5032	How sick is the patient?	24
5033	House spoke to the wife.	24
5034	I came to speak with Dr.	24
5035	I can get the words out.	24
5036	I admire the creativity.	24
5037	Hey, how's my dad doing?	24
5038	Hey, look, we'll adjust.	24
5039	I don't have a headache.	24
5040	I don't know what it is.	24
5041	escalate things somehow.	24
5042	Except there's no blood.	24
5043	For the wrong diagnosis.	24
5044	Ha ha ha! This is great.	24
5045	Hair samples were clean.	24
5046	He beat you! What is it?	24
5047	He came here last night.	24
5048	He coached youth soccer.	24
5049	He wants to relive this.	24
5050	Gave me my brother back.	24
5051	Get him adenosine, stat.	24
5052	Get out alive on Friday.	24
5053	Give me a machida scope.	24
5054	He's obviously paranoid.	24
5055	He's the better surgeon.	24
5056	Girl says, yeah, me too.	24
5057	He's got pictures of us.	24
5058	He's in togood of shape.	24
5059	Brother against brother.	24
5060	Bus pass, thrift stores.	24
5061	But-- Do what Park says.	24
5062	But he needed an excuse.	24
5063	Capillary refill's good.	24
5064	Clearly, you suck at it.	24
5065	Either way, I'm covered.	24
5066	Drew wasn't deaf! House.	24
5067	Diazepam was masking it.	24
5068	Didn't sleep last night.	24
5069	Disgustingly satisfying.	24
5070	Don't get your hopes up.	24
5071	An intact immune system.	24
5072	And by we, you mean you.	24
5073	And here's a bigger one.	24
5074	And I was all, how come?	24
5075	And if it doesn't start?	24
5076	And I'm not one of them.	24
5077	And that's not a bullet.	24
5078	And the nurses love you.	24
5079	A hot tub would be cool.	24
5080	A little poetic license.	24
5081	All right, fine, clever.	24
5082	as far as you can prove.	24
5083	At least I wish I would.	24
5084	Autonomic dysregulation.	24
5085	Because there isn't one.	24
5086	Because you're an idiot.	24
5087	Anita, she's fun, smart.	24
5088	Are you now on the team?	24
5089	We're over five minutes.	24
5090	What are you doing here?	24
5091	Vicodin repeating on me.	24
5092	Was I dehydrated or not?	24
5093	We took a cooking class.	24
5094	We'll take care of Nick.	24
5095	We're in the car, honey.	24
5096	What if you're allright?	24
5097	What was his heart rate?	24
5098	Why would I do this now?	24
5099	Why does he have a file?	24
5100	When I ate strawberries.	24
5101	Who am I talking to now?	24
5102	Who says I have baggage?	24
5103	That's what I just said.	24
5104	That's what I object to.	24
5105	That's why you left him?	24
5106	The bathroom's that way.	24
5107	The joy that he gave me.	24
5108	The windows were closed.	24
5109	Then animal ghost cases.	24
5110	Turns out I like boring.	24
5111	They are kind of boring.	24
5112	They hurt all your bits.	24
5113	They're being relocated.	24
5114	This is a thyroid issue.	24
5115	This is a waste of time.	24
5116	This is all that's left.	24
5117	This is our orientation.	24
5118	This would totally suck.	24
5119	You're making a mistake.	24
5120	You're missing my point.	24
5121	You're screwing with me.	24
5122	You're such a smart kid.	24
5123	You're covering for him.	24
5124	Your friend got stabbed.	24
5125	You're absolutely right.	24
5126	With polyester uniforms?	24
5127	You applied for the job.	24
5128	You asked me to ask you.	24
5129	You can't afford a team.	24
5130	You can't just take off.	24
5131	You got to work at 9:15.	24
5132	You have a dead patient?	24
5133	You have four days left.	24
5134	You just slept with her.	24
5135	You may even believe it.	24
5136	You need your own place.	24
5137	You own things you want.	24
5138	You really believe that.	24
5139	You two know each other?	24
5140	You used Adams' shampoo.	24
5141	You wanted me to meddle.	24
5142	You were CEO since 1988.	24
5143	What were you thinking?	23
5144	And then what happened?	23
5145	It's not all about you.	23
5146	I'm wrong all the time.	23
5147	Imagine how sorry I am.	23
5148	I'm sure she succeeded.	23
5149	It came out of nowhere.	23
5150	Is he going to be okay?	23
5151	Is she on the team now?	23
5152	I'm sorry about before.	23
5153	Keep food in the house.	23
5154	Maybe thrombocytopenia.	23
5155	Mom's hiding something.	23
5156	Lighten the anesthesia.	23
5157	Just look at the light.	23
5158	It's what my dad wants.	23
5159	It should have been me.	23
5160	It sort of does for me.	23
5161	It wasn't my boyfriend.	23
5162	It wouldn't cross them.	23
5163	It's a conclusive test.	23
5164	I'll keep looking here.	23
5165	I'll pick something up.	23
5166	I'll take this outside.	23
5167	I'm being professional.	23
5168	I'm going back to work.	23
5169	I'm going to admit you.	23
5170	I'm not sloppy seconds.	23
5171	I'm not working, House.	23
5172	I think it's his liver.	23
5173	I think you should too.	23
5174	I should have told you.	23
5175	I think House is right.	23
5176	I think I may throw up.	23
5177	I want to be with them.	23
5178	I was an ass last week.	23
5179	Now, that is authentic.	23
5180	Or it's something else.	23
5181	People are complicated.	23
5182	No about it and no ifs.	23
5183	No contact, whatsoever.	23
5184	No tenderness, no pain.	23
5185	Means you could stroke.	23
5186	Not here in the states.	23
5187	Not if he took aspirin.	23
5188	Not some hipster thing.	23
5189	Not a fungal infection.	23
5190	Not a Pheochromocytoma.	23
5191	Nice clothes and anger.	23
5192	Move your cane, please.	23
5193	So whose urine is that?	23
5194	So that's really weird.	23
5195	So this isn't diabetes?	23
5196	So what's next for you?	23
5197	Talking about medicine.	23
5198	Taub, you got a minute?	23
5199	Syph test was negative.	23
5200	Start him on radiation.	23
5201	Sensory level is at l5.	23
5202	Retro-ocular infection?	23
5203	Please stop calling me.	23
5204	put him on antiemetics.	23
5205	Quarters came in handy.	23
5206	She's not going to die.	23
5207	I have two little boys.	23
5208	I didn't say I changed.	23
5209	I punched my attending.	23
5210	I said don't interrupt.	23
5211	I shot him in the head.	23
5212	I have staff searching.	23
5213	I know how you operate.	23
5214	I mentioned it because.	23
5215	I might've missed that.	23
5216	How are you holding up?	23
5217	How can he not be dead?	23
5218	His ICP was not normal.	23
5219	His parents died young.	23
5220	His sclera's jaundiced.	23
5221	House is also a fiasco.	23
5222	I don't know what kind.	23
5223	I could barely breathe.	23
5224	Fever came on too fast.	23
5225	He said he was at work.	23
5226	He said you walked out.	23
5227	He said you'd say that.	23
5228	Get me her O-two level.	23
5229	Get out! Where's Sykes?	23
5230	Good for you! You loon.	23
5231	Got to move it, people.	23
5232	Here's your five grand.	23
5233	Here's your new office.	23
5234	He's a bit of a sleaze.	23
5235	He's got his team back.	23
5236	He's not hallucinating.	23
5237	He's not stuck with me.	23
5238	Boys, do a home search.	23
5239	But family comes first.	23
5240	But not just there, um.	23
5241	But you'll get over it.	23
5242	But, yes, you're right.	23
5243	'Cause I'm hurting him.	23
5244	Callie agrees with you.	23
5245	Drop it off in my cell.	23
5246	Could be pre-eclampsia.	23
5247	Could extend your life.	23
5248	Did I have an epidural?	23
5249	Do you think I'm right?	23
5250	Doctors Adams and Park.	23
5251	Don't come in tomorrow.	23
5252	Don't look at the book.	23
5253	Don't tell me you have.	23
5254	An insignificant token.	23
5255	And I do mean rule out.	23
5256	And if it's not a clot?	23
5257	And I'm not acting out.	23
5258	And neither should you.	23
5259	And rust means Arsenic.	23
5260	A little out of bounds?	23
5261	Airway resistance down.	23
5262	Ah, mm, yeah, actually.	23
5263	Arterial pulse is good.	23
5264	And you weren't before?	23
5265	Any reason I shouldn't?	23
5266	We're missing symptoms.	23
5267	Were you angry with Dr.	23
5268	Well, I'm walking back.	23
5269	Was it really worth it?	23
5270	We called 'em Drewisms.	23
5271	We can't smoke in here.	23
5272	We don't have a choice.	23
5273	We need a sniper rifle.	23
5274	We watched a lot of TV.	23
5275	What else don't I know?	23
5276	What day did Jesus die?	23
5277	We'll have lunch, okay?	23
5278	Well, don't look at me.	23
5279	What was wrong with me?	23
5280	What fun would that be?	23
5281	What's happening to me?	23
5282	Why would I need a gun?	23
5283	Why are you still here?	23
5284	Why is it still rising?	23
5285	When I saw her waiting.	23
5286	Which means not family.	23
5287	Why are you doing time?	23
5288	That's what he implied.	23
5289	The cure will kill him.	23
5290	The lungs are a smoker.	23
5291	The other one's Sophia.	23
5292	That comes with a rash.	23
5293	That is so fifth grade.	23
5294	That was pure luck too.	23
5295	That's not what I said.	23
5296	The patient was faking?	23
5297	There was nothing owed.	23
5298	Thanks for all my help.	23
5299	Straight as after that.	23
5300	There's no actual risk.	23
5301	They look just like me.	23
5302	They were good parents.	23
5303	They're also delicious.	23
5304	They're gonna wear off.	23
5305	Those who can't, teach.	23
5306	You've got your office.	23
5307	You're not allowed out.	23
5308	You weren't even there.	23
5309	You're in the hospital.	23
5310	Why'd you really do it?	23
5311	Your symptoms are real.	23
5312	With no local symptoms?	23
5313	Would you look at this?	23
5314	You can help with that?	23
5315	You didn't hurt anyone.	23
5316	You don't have a fever.	23
5317	You don't need to stay.	23
5318	You find another angle.	23
5319	You hate ice cream too?	23
5320	You need that medicine.	23
5321	You owe me 106,804 won.	23
5322	You really didn't know?	23
5323	You said it hurt a bit.	23
5324	You saved a man's life.	23
5325	We're in the hospital.	22
5326	Get your hands off me.	22
5327	So he just walked out?	22
5328	It's already too long.	22
5329	It's for his own good.	22
5330	It's his risk to take.	22
5331	It's like we're twins.	22
5332	It's not an infection.	22
5333	It's not endocarditis.	22
5334	It's not in the plans.	22
5335	I'm working! How much?	22
5336	I'm telling the truth.	22
5337	I'm thinking brucella.	22
5338	Maybe I'll understand.	22
5339	Mom drank, dad worked.	22
5340	Let's get out of here.	22
5341	Just to get his money.	22
5342	Just wrong about what?	22
5343	It's probably nothing.	22
5344	It makes a difference.	22
5345	It was a 50/50 choice.	22
5346	It was a little harsh.	22
5347	It was nobody's fault.	22
5348	It wouldn't be a gift.	22
5349	I was being authentic.	22
5350	I was just a teenager.	22
5351	I'll drive over there.	22
5352	I'll leave you and Dr.	22
5353	I'm a little confused.	22
5354	I'm gonna call your P.	22
5355	I'm not going to lose.	22
5356	I'm only here to help.	22
5357	I'd like you to do it.	22
5358	I think it was eerily.	22
5359	I thought it was lead.	22
5360	I wasn't at a funeral.	22
5361	I wouldn't believe it.	22
5362	Oh, whatever it takes.	22
5363	Oh, you could P.C. up.	22
5364	Oh, you think they're.	22
5365	Patriotism is natural.	22
5366	No Grey-Turner's sign.	22
5367	No ifs, ands, or buts.	22
5368	My girlfriend's clean.	22
5369	My patient needs this.	22
5370	My car is in the shop.	22
5371	Not sure what this is.	22
5372	Not taking your calls?	22
5373	Nobody knows I'm here.	22
5374	My, uh, my back hurts.	22
5375	So forget being sorry.	22
5376	So I can look at them.	22
5377	So who cheated on you?	22
5378	Sorry about yesterday.	22
5379	Spoiled grandchildren.	22
5380	Start an I.V. Come on.	22
5381	Start her on pressors.	22
5382	Stealing's all I know.	22
5383	Reminded me of our St.	22
5384	Rain check, I promise.	22
5385	Ran in front of a car.	22
5386	Oxygenation's at 100%.	22
5387	Please, um, it's okay.	22
5388	Plenty of food, water.	22
5389	pumped him full of it.	22
5390	Sex releases oxytocin.	22
5391	She can see perfectly.	22
5392	She'll die without it.	22
5393	She's not on any meds.	22
5394	She's responding well.	22
5395	Should have clarified.	22
5396	I just wanna be happy.	22
5397	I gave those away too.	22
5398	I got something to do.	22
5399	I don't need an A.B.G.	22
5400	I remember everything.	22
5401	I say we tell the kid.	22
5402	How was the Brazilian?	22
5403	How did that turn out?	22
5404	House finally got you.	22
5405	Hey, that is not okay.	22
5406	I don't know how, but.	22
5407	I ain't got no stereo.	22
5408	I also have kind eyes.	22
5409	Ever surf Kirra point?	22
5410	Everything looks good.	22
5411	Except for the again .	22
5412	Explains the bleeding.	22
5413	Family vacations kill.	22
5414	Forging prescriptions?	22
5415	Found it in my office.	22
5416	Guilt-colored glasses.	22
5417	Have you been married?	22
5418	He asked who you were.	22
5419	He couldn't say zebra.	22
5420	He didn't have a rash.	22
5421	He needs a transplant.	22
5422	He never had melanoma.	22
5423	He was okay with that?	22
5424	Get O.R. Ten unpacked.	22
5425	God, but you're petty.	22
5426	Got something for you.	22
5427	He's having a seizure.	22
5428	He's in a crypt at St.	22
5429	He's never gonna know.	22
5430	Case is under control.	22
5431	Cold fingers and toes?	22
5432	Can I see the monitor?	22
5433	Can you do me a favor?	22
5434	Drag Queens in Uganda.	22
5435	Did they tell you why?	22
5436	Discharge the patient.	22
5437	Don't get too excited.	22
5438	And Andrews is a hack.	22
5439	And by you, I mean me.	22
5440	And I don't own a gun.	22
5441	And she needs an LVAD.	22
5442	About the crazy stuff?	22
5443	About the other night.	22
5444	Actually, there's two.	22
5445	Are your ears ringing?	22
5446	Aren't surfing enough.	22
5447	And what's brown mean?	22
5448	Book a procedure room.	22
5449	What about a year ago?	22
5450	What about over there?	22
5451	want to just have fun?	22
5452	want you to have them.	22
5453	We need to ultrasound.	22
5454	We removed the artery.	22
5455	We stayed at my place.	22
5456	We tried that already.	22
5457	We watched a lotta TV.	22
5458	What are you gonna do?	22
5459	We're discharging him.	22
5460	We're gonna try again.	22
5461	What took you so long?	22
5462	What's the difference?	22
5463	What's the first step?	22
5464	What's your evil plan?	22
5465	That's why I did this.	22
5466	That's why I told you.	22
5467	That's your follow-up?	22
5468	The bulge in his neck.	22
5469	The kid's our patient.	22
5470	Then we're going home.	22
5471	That could be fixable.	22
5472	That counts for a lot.	22
5473	That is, if I'm right.	22
5474	That was 12 years ago.	22
5475	That's a mixed signal.	22
5476	That's my dark secret.	22
5477	That's naive and sick.	22
5478	That's not gonna help.	22
5479	To tell him the truth.	22
5480	Two days, one surgery.	22
5481	There was no repartee.	22
5482	Take him out of there.	22
5483	There's no joint pain.	22
5484	They were spectacular.	22
5485	They're shutting down.	22
5486	This case is a fiasco.	22
5487	This is Aaron Rodgers.	22
5488	This man's Ben's hero.	22
5489	This was House's idea.	22
5490	Thoracic cavity clear.	22
5491	You're not a stranger.	22
5492	You're not infallible.	22
5493	You're pro-infidelity?	22
5494	What's wrong with him?	22
5495	You're getting weaker.	22
5496	You're still a doctor.	22
5497	You're taking my head.	22
5498	You're welcome, House.	22
5499	Your patient's stable?	22
5500	Your son worships him.	22
5501	You're a creative guy.	22
5502	You're a smart doctor.	22
5503	You expecting someone?	22
5504	You heard the calling?	22
5505	You just lost my vote.	22
5506	You know I'm a doctor.	22
5507	You know what that is?	22
5508	You need a girlfriend.	22
5509	You saved my life too.	22
5510	You scare me a little.	22
5511	You think it's cancer?	22
5512	You went to my school.	22
5513	You were already sick.	22
5514	What's wrong with me?	21
5515	It's a press release.	21
5516	It's called syphilis.	21
5517	It's his lymph nodes.	21
5518	Is that why you left?	21
5519	It can hit any organ.	21
5520	Is it the electrodes?	21
5521	Magnesium deficiency?	21
5522	make a counter offer.	21
5523	Lying to the patient.	21
5524	Makes me think D.I.C.	21
5525	Maybe she has cancer.	21
5526	Maybe that's selfish.	21
5527	Monitor the aneurysm.	21
5528	More like 13 minutes.	21
5529	more than one person.	21
5530	Let's finish this up.	21
5531	Like an ironic thing?	21
5532	It's our only choice.	21
5533	It's part of the job.	21
5534	It's Reye's syndrome.	21
5535	Just before you were.	21
5536	It sounds silly, but.	21
5537	It was a rainy night.	21
5538	It was close to here.	21
5539	It wasn't your fault.	21
5540	It's 10:15 on Friday.	21
5541	It's a brain problem.	21
5542	It's a major surgery.	21
5543	I'll do the flushing.	21
5544	I'm glad you're back.	21
5545	I'm happy I knew you.	21
5546	I'm here for Vanessa.	21
5547	I'm never quite sure.	21
5548	I'm not being a dick.	21
5549	I'm not shooting you.	21
5550	I think his gist was.	21
5551	One shot, one birdie.	21
5552	Okay, boys and girls.	21
5553	Oh, I'm not pregnant.	21
5554	Orange means Mercury.	21
5555	Please be respectful.	21
5556	No blood circulating.	21
5557	No history of asthma.	21
5558	No, I think it's sad.	21
5559	my heart rate is not.	21
5560	My process is proven.	21
5561	My schedule's a mess.	21
5562	Must be some mistake.	21
5563	Not for your reasons.	21
5564	Not much of anything.	21
5565	Nothing is ever over.	21
5566	Need a lift tomorrow?	21
5567	New office furniture.	21
5568	Nice to meet you, Dr.	21
5569	No, now they're sore.	21
5570	No, you don't say no.	21
5571	So you'll let him go?	21
5572	So maybe she's lying.	21
5573	So we've got nothing.	21
5574	So what's the answer?	21
5575	Saving two is better.	21
5576	Ruby dropped her off.	21
5577	Reduced clinic hours.	21
5578	Sounds like drowning.	21
5579	Reveal yourself! Now.	21
5580	Ray! Leave him alone.	21
5581	Please don't fire me.	21
5582	Pull down your pants.	21
5583	She asked me to come.	21
5584	She never even cried.	21
5585	I just don't like it.	21
5586	I grabbed Park's ass.	21
5587	I guess that sounded.	21
5588	I don't take charity.	21
5589	I don't think so, no.	21
5590	I ran away from home.	21
5591	I know this is tough.	21
5592	How many do you want?	21
5593	I can't feel my arms.	21
5594	I can't feel my legs.	21
5595	I can't let you move.	21
5596	I can't pay you back.	21
5597	I don't believe that.	21
5598	I don't know, um, he.	21
5599	I denied his request.	21
5600	Forget about the bet.	21
5601	French vanilla, yeah.	21
5602	From what I remember.	21
5603	Guys, get your stuff.	21
5604	He always has a plan.	21
5605	He grabbed my behind.	21
5606	He had a brain tumor.	21
5607	He just held my hand.	21
5608	He was an only child.	21
5609	Heart rate's only 90.	21
5610	He'll ruin my career.	21
5611	Her D-dimer's normal.	21
5612	Get her into O.R. 11.	21
5613	Give them to someone?	21
5614	Go biopsy to confirm.	21
5615	God, I miss my boobs.	21
5616	Gonna hurt, isn't it?	21
5617	Hey, don't be an ass.	21
5618	He's enlightening us.	21
5619	He's got Alzheimer's.	21
5620	Both seems excessive.	21
5621	But a girl has needs.	21
5622	But we're on a clock.	21
5623	But you don't buy it.	21
5624	But you used to hurt?	21
5625	Can't treat for both.	21
5626	'Cause I have a gift.	21
5627	Celibacy is a choice.	21
5628	Chang and Eng Bunker.	21
5629	Check the ventricles.	21
5630	Cut yourself shaving?	21
5631	devastated, betrayed?	21
5632	Did I nick something?	21
5633	Did okay before that.	21
5634	Did you just do that?	21
5635	Do you have a minute?	21
5636	An allergic reaction.	21
5637	And it's not a fight.	21
5638	Actually you have to.	21
5639	Arrhythmias are gone.	21
5640	Ascending colangitis.	21
5641	Beard's a nice touch.	21
5642	Antibiotics and IVIG.	21
5643	Appears to be a gift.	21
5644	Appreciate your help.	21
5645	Approaching the clot.	21
5646	What about porphyria?	21
5647	What about Whipple's?	21
5648	Well, what if it was?	21
5649	we did what we could.	21
5650	We shouldn't be here.	21
5651	We'd risk aspiration.	21
5652	What is this, Canada?	21
5653	Why would he do that?	21
5654	When did Cuddy leave?	21
5655	When you saw the boy.	21
5656	Who the hell are you?	21
5657	the flag football ga.	21
5658	The Mexican pipeline.	21
5659	The test is negative.	21
5660	That's my whiteboard.	21
5661	That's not an answer.	21
5662	Tox screen was clean.	21
5663	Trust me on this one.	21
5664	There's always chemo.	21
5665	They found the tumor.	21
5666	They ruin everything.	21
5667	They're not starving.	21
5668	Things are different.	21
5669	This is a good thing.	21
5670	This is my only copy.	21
5671	You've got neighbors.	21
5672	You're moving slower.	21
5673	You're in a hospital.	21
5674	You're using an iPod.	21
5675	Why'd I even have to?	21
5676	Will that still work?	21
5677	Yes, and your sanity.	21
5678	You'd better be fast.	21
5679	You're a changed man.	21
5680	You're a sucky clown.	21
5681	You're abandoning me?	21
5682	With some difficulty.	21
5683	Won't be fast enough.	21
5684	You admire this girl.	21
5685	You don't believe me?	21
5686	You dropped in the U.	21
5687	You handle his house.	21
5688	You have a boyfriend?	21
5689	You have any matches?	21
5690	You just got stabbed.	21
5691	You look healthy, so.	21
5692	You love your family.	21
5693	You must be somebody.	21
5694	You said I was wrong.	21
5695	You slept with a nun?	21
5696	You think she should?	21
5697	You were just a baby.	21
5698	Where are you going?	20
5699	You're off the case.	20
5700	Something like that.	20
5701	It's called respect.	20
5702	It's healing itself.	20
5703	It's not meningitis.	20
5704	I'm talking to Taub.	20
5705	It different enough.	20
5706	Is it a dead animal?	20
5707	It's not ridiculous.	20
5708	Look at it this way.	20
5709	Kidneys are failing.	20
5710	more than they need.	20
5711	leaked into his arm.	20
5712	Lemierre's Syndrome.	20
5713	Let Rodrigo do this.	20
5714	Let's go! Hey! Wait.	20
5715	It's your own fault.	20
5716	I've spoken with Dr.	20
5717	Just get a pulse OX.	20
5718	It is gonna be hard.	20
5719	It is possible, but.	20
5720	It was manipulation.	20
5721	I'll give it to you.	20
5722	I'm gonna try again.	20
5723	I'm kind of a wreck.	20
5724	I'm Miss Cedarville.	20
5725	I'd like to do that.	20
5726	I shouldn't be here.	20
5727	I talk to prisoners.	20
5728	I went by neurology.	20
5729	I won't go near her.	20
5730	I would do it again.	20
5731	Okay, I'll go first.	20
5732	Okay, uh, thank you.	20
5733	Oh, lighten up, Sis.	20
5734	Now say I was right.	20
5735	People call him T.O.	20
5736	people don't change.	20
5737	People need answers.	20
5738	No one even noticed.	20
5739	My heart will go on.	20
5740	Not touching anyone.	20
5741	Not with this fever.	20
5742	Neck veins are flat.	20
5743	So glad I was wrong.	20
5744	Says so in the file.	20
5745	Taking my vic-amins.	20
5746	Seemed pretty upset.	20
5747	Seems healthy to me.	20
5748	Our patient woke up.	20
5749	Our patient's dying.	20
5750	She said she's done.	20
5751	She's a good doctor.	20
5752	She's an ex-florist.	20
5753	She's the crazy one.	20
5754	I heard he was sick.	20
5755	I hurt Callie a lot.	20
5756	I just got so angry.	20
5757	I have fun with you.	20
5758	I feel kinda badass.	20
5759	I gave him a condom.	20
5760	I didn't deserve it.	20
5761	I didn't say it was.	20
5762	I don't want to lie.	20
5763	I met him at school.	20
5764	I need a DNA sample.	20
5765	How does that sound?	20
5766	How is that feeling?	20
5767	How are you feeling?	20
5768	His daughter's sick.	20
5769	House won't go home.	20
5770	House, I'm starving.	20
5771	House, welcome back.	20
5772	Here, you want this?	20
5773	I do, I can, I have.	20
5774	I don't feel very w.	20
5775	I cheated on Denise.	20
5776	I checked your file.	20
5777	I deserved the slap.	20
5778	I did listen to you.	20
5779	Excellent deduction.	20
5780	Explains everything.	20
5781	Filling up the tank.	20
5782	For the massage bed.	20
5783	He doesn't have one.	20
5784	He said cryptically.	20
5785	He said it was okay.	20
5786	He touched me first.	20
5787	Hear the difference?	20
5788	Her imaging's clean.	20
5789	Get him out of here.	20
5790	Get my old job back.	20
5791	Get out of my house.	20
5792	Give you a big hint.	20
5793	God, I missed doors.	20
5794	He's so new to this.	20
5795	He's still in there.	20
5796	He's the supervisor.	20
5797	Hey, can't talk now.	20
5798	Getting some ectopy.	20
5799	Girls, do lab tests.	20
5800	Got lucky this time.	20
5801	Gotta give 'em that.	20
5802	Grab a consent form.	20
5803	Bounding, four-plus.	20
5804	But he is effective.	20
5805	But I'm assuming Dr.	20
5806	But they're so cute.	20
5807	But we've moved out.	20
5808	But you're not sure.	20
5809	'Cause I called her.	20
5810	'Cause you're a dad.	20
5811	Call Chase and Taub.	20
5812	Can I go to bed now?	20
5813	Can you hear me, Mr.	20
5814	Eh--compared to who?	20
5815	Ended up doing both.	20
5816	Do an exercise test.	20
5817	And it was too hard.	20
5818	And Social Services.	20
5819	And taking Oxy just.	20
5820	About me not caring?	20
5821	About ten hours old.	20
5822	15 more minutes, Mr.	20
5823	Aerosolized Heparin.	20
5824	Are you saying it's.	20
5825	As I was saying, Dr.	20
5826	Asthma or something.	20
5827	And when I remember.	20
5828	And yet you hit her.	20
5829	angry and miserable?	20
5830	Apparently you were.	20
5831	We're not done here.	20
5832	We've never had sex.	20
5833	What about Thirteen?	20
5834	What are we missing?	20
5835	Well, I was the mom.	20
5836	Well, I'll tell you.	20
5837	Well, you know what?	20
5838	Was that table here?	20
5839	Wasn't my best joke.	20
5840	We got to go for it.	20
5841	We need to not talk.	20
5842	We should know soon.	20
5843	What does that mean?	20
5844	What does this mean?	20
5845	What was in the box?	20
5846	What'd you give him?	20
5847	Why are you up here?	20
5848	Why is it my choice?	20
5849	Where have you been?	20
5850	The thing is, House.	20
5851	Their son just died.	20
5852	That sounds hopeful.	20
5853	That was made clear.	20
5854	That went over well.	20
5855	That's a good start.	20
5856	That's just hurtful.	20
5857	That's not medicine.	20
5858	That's not the same.	20
5859	Tox screen is clear.	20
5860	Toxins are the most.	20
5861	Transverse myelitis.	20
5862	Uh, can we help you?	20
5863	Unless you're wrong.	20
5864	Unfortunately, yeah.	20
5865	Take off my monitor.	20
5866	Sure you are, buddy.	20
5867	they're minty fresh.	20
5868	They're more honest.	20
5869	They're my students.	20
5870	This guy's an idiot.	20
5871	This swab's for you.	20
5872	You're House, right?	20
5873	You're beyond fired.	20
5874	Yes! Franklin rules.	20
5875	Yes, you were right.	20
5876	You won't need this.	20
5877	You're always right.	20
5878	Would never do that.	20
5879	You can do anything.	20
5880	You can read people.	20
5881	You can't feel them?	20
5882	You don't feel that?	20
5883	You had a big fight.	20
5884	You just getting in?	20
5885	You never liked him.	20
5886	You re-pitched an S.	20
5887	You shoulda seen it.	20
5888	You understand that?	20
5889	What are you doing?	19
5890	I don't understand.	19
5891	Is everything okay?	19
5892	It's a possibility.	19
5893	It's a simple test.	19
5894	It's a small world.	19
5895	It's a stupid idea.	19
5896	It's all her fault.	19
5897	It's not gonorrhea.	19
5898	It's not her brain.	19
5899	It's not his heart.	19
5900	It's not his liver.	19
5901	It's not important.	19
5902	I'm Walter Cofield.	19
5903	Is that Portuguese?	19
5904	Is it a can opener?	19
5905	It's not stressful.	19
5906	It's not the cause.	19
5907	It's not Whipple's.	19
5908	made things easier.	19
5909	Lungs are crashing.	19
5910	Mallory-Weiss tear.	19
5911	It's pretty genius.	19
5912	It's under control.	19
5913	It is in the water.	19
5914	it overwhelmed him.	19
5915	It was good advice.	19
5916	It wasn't the food.	19
5917	It wasn't uncommon.	19
5918	It's a German name.	19
5919	I was married once.	19
5920	I was running away.	19
5921	I'll explain later.	19
5922	I'll be in surgery.	19
5923	I'll be right back.	19
5924	I'll call you back.	19
5925	I'm gonna fix this.	19
5926	I'm running to God.	19
5927	ICU isolation room.	19
5928	I'd like to sit in.	19
5929	I think I love you.	19
5930	I want the surgery.	19
5931	I was a seminarian.	19
5932	Oh, now you're shy.	19
5933	Once you sign this.	19
5934	Objectivity, House.	19
5935	Oh, come on, honey.	19
5936	Oh, honey, come on.	19
5937	Oh, my God! Andres.	19
5938	One-room apartment.	19
5939	Patient's unstable.	19
5940	People respect you.	19
5941	Plan's to cure her.	19
5942	No more chest pain.	19
5943	No one to help you?	19
5944	No, no, no, no, no.	19
5945	My mechanic called.	19
5946	Multiple aneurysms.	19
5947	New life, new look.	19
5948	New team, old team.	19
5949	Moved around a lot.	19
5950	Taub, it's Foreman.	19
5951	Thank you, officer.	19
5952	Paresthesia's gone.	19
5953	Park, come with me.	19
5954	Polyester uniforms?	19
5955	Prep him for chemo.	19
5956	She got it from me.	19
5957	She's not pregnant.	19
5958	She's staying here.	19
5959	I hope it pays off.	19
5960	I had a bad lawyer.	19
5961	I had strep throat.	19
5962	I had to get a job.	19
5963	I hate conferences.	19
5964	I have Alzheimer's.	19
5965	I have another one.	19
5966	I have Hepatitis C.	19
5967	I felt like crying.	19
5968	I felt the calling.	19
5969	How's your patient?	19
5970	I didn't jump ship.	19
5971	I don't like gifts.	19
5972	I said I was wrong.	19
5973	I know, I look bad.	19
5974	I like naval stuff.	19
5975	I need your advice.	19
5976	How advanced is he?	19
5977	How come she's not.	19
5978	His BP is dropping.	19
5979	Doubly interesting.	19
5980	Got a case for you.	19
5981	Everybody loved me.	19
5982	Everyone's covered.	19
5983	Fluconazole, right?	19
5984	For both our sakes.	19
5985	Haven't read these.	19
5986	He didn't have one.	19
5987	He had Drew's eyes.	19
5988	He knew the answer.	19
5989	He owns an arsenal.	19
5990	He saved two lives.	19
5991	He was in a jostle.	19
5992	Get him to the ICU.	19
5993	Get me a trach kit.	19
5994	Give me some swabs.	19
5995	Go do the EP study.	19
5996	Good carotid pulse.	19
5997	He's only guessing.	19
5998	He's a good friend.	19
5999	Burkitt's lymphoma.	19
6000	But House found it.	19
6001	But if you want to.	19
6002	But I--I wasn't on.	19
6003	But it's theorized.	19
6004	But they will grow.	19
6005	But when Drew died.	19
6006	But, uh, thank you.	19
6007	Chase respects you.	19
6008	Cholesterol emboli?	19
6009	Come on, Mendelson.	19
6010	Dated last Tuesday.	19
6011	Dead men don't pee.	19
6012	Do what House says.	19
6013	Doesn't make sense.	19
6014	Don't feel too bad.	19
6015	Don't let it be us.	19
6016	don't take charity.	19
6017	And find something.	19
6018	And I'll take Park.	19
6019	And I'm sorry, but.	19
6020	And then I met you.	19
6021	45-caliber bullets.	19
6022	A history textbook.	19
6023	A pheochromocytoma.	19
6024	About a decade ago.	19
6025	After you admit it.	19
6026	Atropine poisoning.	19
6027	And yet it happens.	19
6028	Blood in his urine.	19
6029	Been used in sheep.	19
6030	Any other symptoms?	19
6031	We're not in touch.	19
6032	What about my team?	19
6033	Violating the dead.	19
6034	Walking on her own.	19
6035	Was nobody's fault.	19
6036	We caught it early.	19
6037	We haven't had sex.	19
6038	Wait, he was drunk?	19
6039	Well it's not ARDS.	19
6040	We're almost there.	19
6041	What is this about?	19
6042	What kind of drugs?	19
6043	What's House up to?	19
6044	Where was practice?	19
6045	Where's my husband?	19
6046	Where's my patient?	19
6047	White-collar crime?	19
6048	That's what I said.	19
6049	The chair squeaked.	19
6050	The explosion does.	19
6051	The ol' swap trick?	19
6052	The sound is quack.	19
6053	There is a symptom.	19
6054	That can't be good.	19
6055	That is ridiculous.	19
6056	That's a good idea.	19
6057	That's an oxymoron.	19
6058	That's my old boss.	19
6059	That's not a favor.	19
6060	That's really dark.	19
6061	To the proof store.	19
6062	Unfortunately, yes.	19
6063	They tell you that?	19
6064	Thirteen was right.	19
6065	This is ridiculous.	19
6066	This is your liver.	19
6067	What's the problem?	19
6068	You're in the PACU.	19
6069	You're tachycardic.	19
6070	Yes! Now I'm angry.	19
6071	You'll get over it.	19
6072	You're a TV Doctor?	19
6073	Works for everyone?	19
6074	You always do this.	19
6075	You can keep these.	19
6076	you didn't need it.	19
6077	You didn't tell me.	19
6078	You do work for me.	19
6079	You get used to it.	19
6080	You had a manicure.	19
6081	You hunt kangaroos?	19
6082	You know it's true.	19
6083	You mean literally?	19
6084	You should be okay.	19
6085	You took my stereo?	19
6086	You want them back.	19
6087	You want to say it.	19
6088	You wanted me back.	19
6089	Wills to recovery.	18
6090	What's the matter?	18
6091	That's ridiculous.	18
6092	Give her the file.	18
6093	I didn't tell him.	18
6094	On the other hand.	18
6095	It's above normal.	18
6096	It's for the best.	18
6097	It's mastocytosis.	18
6098	It's neurological.	18
6099	It's not my fault.	18
6100	It's not possible.	18
6101	Is he tamponading?	18
6102	Is he--is he good?	18
6103	It's not the guns.	18
6104	It's okay, Andres.	18
6105	Look for yourself.	18
6106	Knee-length dress.	18
6107	Look what I found.	18
6108	Let's let it drop.	18
6109	Let's release him.	18
6110	It was my husband.	18
6111	It wasn't her mom.	18
6112	It'll be terrible.	18
6113	I was in the room.	18
6114	I'll get the food.	18
6115	I'll bet House re.	18
6116	I'll do it myself.	18
6117	I'm a drug addict.	18
6118	I'm a good doctor.	18
6119	I'm not a nutcase.	18
6120	I'm not an addict.	18
6121	I'm not giving up.	18
6122	I stand corrected.	18
6123	I took a vacation.	18
6124	I wasn't thinking.	18
6125	I will shred this.	18
6126	Now's your chance.	18
6127	Oh, of course not.	18
6128	Okay, I'm curious.	18
6129	Oh, come on, Iris.	18
6130	Oh, my God, Chase.	18
6131	Nothing's changed.	18
6132	Notify the police.	18
6133	Perfectly logical.	18
6134	No abdominal pain.	18
6135	No need for proof.	18
6136	No need for tests.	18
6137	No pulse, no body.	18
6138	No, neither of us.	18
6139	My boss dumped me.	18
6140	Might as well ask.	18
6141	Not a good choice.	18
6142	Not a lot of them.	18
6143	Most happiness is.	18
6144	Move your ass, Mr.	18
6145	So don't tell him.	18
6146	Screw the parents.	18
6147	Thank you, Doctor.	18
6148	Palpate the S.C.M.	18
6149	Pupils are normal.	18
6150	Quack quack quack.	18
6151	She can handle it.	18
6152	She needs surgery.	18
6153	She told you that?	18
6154	She's not married.	18
6155	I have work to do.	18
6156	I grew up on Maui.	18
6157	I guess that's it.	18
6158	I hardly know you.	18
6159	I have a headache.	18
6160	I feel, uh, funny.	18
6161	I don't own a gun.	18
6162	I said that I was.	18
6163	I know you object.	18
6164	I made some calls.	18
6165	How are you doing?	18
6166	How are your feet?	18
6167	High-stakes poker.	18
6168	House has a point.	18
6169	House is a genius.	18
6170	House-- it's fake.	18
6171	I can do anything.	18
6172	Hey, take it easy.	18
6173	Got House's phone.	18
6174	I also have these.	18
6175	I am not a reject.	18
6176	I changed my mind.	18
6177	I checked you out.	18
6178	I could do $5,000.	18
6179	I couldn't resist.	18
6180	I deserve respect.	18
6181	I did one of them.	18
6182	Even though I did.	18
6183	Everything's fine.	18
6184	Forget the nerves.	18
6185	Four-year-old kid.	18
6186	From your ex-boss.	18
6187	Fits the symptoms.	18
6188	Foot color's good.	18
6189	Guilty as charged.	18
6190	Haven't you heard?	18
6191	He got in a fight.	18
6192	He hasn't changed.	18
6193	He wants to, yeah.	18
6194	He was an athlete.	18
6195	Healed, thank you.	18
6196	Her BP's dropping.	18
6197	George Washinbaum?	18
6198	Get this straight.	18
6199	He's the boss now.	18
6200	He's a prosecutor.	18
6201	He's anaphylaxing.	18
6202	He's not an idiot.	18
6203	He's not paranoid.	18
6204	Brazilian descent.	18
6205	Breast tenderness.	18
6206	but it's possible.	18
6207	But you said that.	18
6208	Chase did another.	18
6209	Call an ambulance.	18
6210	Ear canal is fine.	18
6211	Do the ultrasound.	18
6212	Doc, what ya need?	18
6213	Does it feel good?	18
6214	Don't count on it.	18
6215	Am I right, Emory?	18
6216	And air freshener.	18
6217	And it feels good.	18
6218	And it's your job.	18
6219	And knock him out.	18
6220	And my money clip.	18
6221	And now you don't?	18
6222	And people change.	18
6223	And the pregnancy.	18
6224	Arrhythmia's back.	18
6225	As far as we know.	18
6226	Asystole in the E.	18
6227	Back off! Oh, God.	18
6228	And where's Chase?	18
6229	Blood, urine, eeg.	18
6230	Boring! I'm sorry.	18
6231	Are you all right?	18
6232	Already went away.	18
6233	We've got nothing.	18
6234	Wanted to see him.	18
6235	We have a problem.	18
6236	What do you think?	18
6237	What does it mean?	18
6238	Vascular scissors.	18
6239	Why would I agree?	18
6240	Where did he play?	18
6241	Where's my stereo?	18
6242	Where's your wife?	18
6243	Which one are you?	18
6244	Which there isn't.	18
6245	White blood cells.	18
6246	That's the reason?	18
6247	The boys are back.	18
6248	The lungs are dry.	18
6249	The mayor checked.	18
6250	That was repartee.	18
6251	That's impossible.	18
6252	To fill that hole.	18
6253	Tommy, what is it?	18
6254	Traffic, for sure.	18
6255	Two ccs Lidocaine.	18
6256	Two prodigal sons.	18
6257	Unfortunately, no.	18
6258	They exist, right?	18
6259	They're polyester.	18
6260	This guy is crazy.	18
6261	This is treatable.	18
6262	Those are Vicodin?	18
6263	Those who can, do.	18
6264	You're going back?	18
6265	You're blaming me?	18
6266	Your February 4th.	18
6267	Worked as a nanny.	18
6268	You find anything?	18
6269	You got the money?	18
6270	You had no lawyer.	18
6271	You know, this is.	18
6272	You mean have sex?	18
6273	You sure you want.	18
6274	What's happening?	17
6275	What's he saying?	17
6276	Unique situation.	17
6277	Why are you here?	17
6278	Biopsy was clean.	17
6279	Could be genetic.	17
6280	How did you know?	17
6281	I don't think so.	17
6282	See you tomorrow.	17
6283	It's been a year.	17
6284	It's been earned.	17
6285	It's in my genes.	17
6286	It's interesting.	17
6287	It's like I said.	17
6288	It's not anxiety.	17
6289	It's not cocaine.	17
6290	Is one of you Dr.	17
6291	is Terrell Owens.	17
6292	Is that an issue?	17
6293	Is that an ulcer?	17
6294	It's not working.	17
6295	I'm sorry, mommy.	17
6296	Mariel Wilkerson.	17
6297	Leaving humanity.	17
6298	Let's hug it out.	17
6299	It makes me feel.	17
6300	It was my theory.	17
6301	It was pure luck.	17
6302	It wasn't enough.	17
6303	I'll double them.	17
6304	I'll send him up.	17
6305	I'm her daughter.	17
6306	I'm in a meeting.	17
6307	I'm kind of busy.	17
6308	I'm multitasking.	17
6309	I'm not an idiot.	17
6310	I'm not paranoid.	17
6311	I'm really sorry.	17
6312	I--I didn't know.	17
6313	If he's paranoid.	17
6314	If she defies me.	17
6315	I sometimes joke.	17
6316	I went to prison.	17
6317	Oh, you mean the.	17
6318	Oh, you're right.	17
6319	Oh, please don't.	17
6320	Of course you do.	17
6321	Or break into it.	17
6322	Patch is holding.	17
6323	No tumor, either.	17
6324	No! You're fired.	17
6325	My feet feel hot.	17
6326	My apologies, Dr.	17
6327	Not what I meant.	17
6328	Normal ace level.	17
6329	Nice to meet you.	17
6330	No, she's guilty.	17
6331	No, we shouldn't.	17
6332	So I chose night.	17
6333	Say you're right.	17
6334	Taub did a third.	17
6335	Taub has decided.	17
6336	Tell me about it.	17
6337	Ten clinic hours.	17
6338	Sorry about that.	17
6339	Stay right there.	17
6340	Seizure activity?	17
6341	Seriously, House?	17
6342	Some VIP visitor.	17
6343	Right back at ya.	17
6344	Pull the trigger.	17
6345	She broke it off.	17
6346	She gave it back.	17
6347	She's gonna live.	17
6348	She's still sick.	17
6349	I just turned 50.	17
6350	I don't like you.	17
6351	I said what else?	17
6352	I know that look.	17
6353	I live with them.	17
6354	I love my family.	17
6355	I meant run away.	17
6356	I need more help.	17
6357	I need your help.	17
6358	I paid the price.	17
6359	How soon is soon?	17
6360	How about warmth?	17
6361	Higher than most.	17
6362	Holding your ass.	17
6363	I can assure you.	17
6364	I agree with her.	17
6365	I don't know how.	17
6366	Extreme altruism.	17
6367	Family gathering.	17
6368	For either of us?	17
6369	Have you seen it?	17
6370	He broke his arm.	17
6371	He can't breathe.	17
6372	He endangered Dr.	17
6373	He has no choice.	17
6374	Get away from me.	17
6375	Get to the point.	17
6376	God spoke to you?	17
6377	God, you're okay.	17
6378	Gift certificate.	17
6379	Got you a coffee.	17
6380	Here's some lube.	17
6381	He's asexual too.	17
6382	He's hypokalemic.	17
6383	He's just stupid.	17
6384	Brugada Syndrome.	17
6385	But he was right.	17
6386	Check your phone.	17
6387	Classic symptoms.	17
6388	Clot in the line?	17
6389	Call me a softie.	17
6390	Callie hates her.	17
6391	Could be the DTs.	17
6392	Could mean lupus.	17
6393	Definitely taxes.	17
6394	Did she tell you?	17
6395	Did we perforate?	17
6396	Do you feel that?	17
6397	Don't answer yet.	17
6398	Don't start that.	17
6399	And ate biscuits.	17
6400	A blood disorder.	17
6401	About a week now.	17
6402	Ah, let me guess.	17
6403	At least a month.	17
6404	Aw, that is cute.	17
6405	And you know why?	17
6406	Blues and Greens.	17
6407	Because I didn't.	17
6408	Bare necessities.	17
6409	Well, that sucks.	17
6410	Ulcer's bleeding.	17
6411	Ultrasound it is.	17
6412	Was that my wife?	17
6413	We have a crisis.	17
6414	We need theories.	17
6415	What do you mean?	17
6416	What do you want?	17
6417	We'll reschedule.	17
6418	What'd you think?	17
6419	Why lie about it?	17
6420	Why the hell not?	17
6421	Why, is that bad?	17
6422	Where's my money?	17
6423	Where's my stuff?	17
6424	Where's the card?	17
6425	Which he started.	17
6426	Which is awesome.	17
6427	Which is step 17.	17
6428	Which would mean.	17
6429	The car accident?	17
6430	The laundry room.	17
6431	The Magic 8 Ball.	17
6432	The one who died.	17
6433	The woman I love.	17
6434	That just leaves.	17
6435	That makes sense.	17
6436	That was nothing.	17
6437	That's also true.	17
6438	That's desperate.	17
6439	That's good news.	17
6440	That's my lotion.	17
6441	That's not a gun.	17
6442	That's not lupus.	17
6443	Tired of surfing.	17
6444	TTP fits, though.	17
6445	Uh, it's nothing.	17
6446	Uh, no, it's, um.	17
6447	Take the damn $2.	17
6448	They're not here.	17
6449	They're not wool.	17

6451	This another pet?	17
6452	This is from now.	17
6453	Wiggle your toes.	17
6454	Wild speculation.	17
6455	You're an addict.	17
6456	With respect, Mr.	17
6457	You are so fired.	17
6458	You don't need P.	17
6459	You go to school?	17
6460	You got a moment?	17
6461	You know we are  	17
6462	You made it, Bud.	17
6463	You made me sick.	17
6464	You own any guns?	17
6465	You saved a life.	17
6466	You were hostile.	17
6467	Congratulations.	16
6468	Please continue.	16
6469	You're an idiot.	16
6470	Why is she here?	16
6471	What did he say?	16
6472	Am I boring you?	16
6473	Can you hear me?	16
6474	Me sinto quente.	16
6475	One, two, three.	16
6476	It's all of you.	16
6477	It's autoimmune.	16
6478	It's clotted up.	16
6479	It's her choice.	16
6480	It's my parents.	16
6481	It's not a clot.	16
6482	It's not a scam.	16
6483	It's not angina.	16
6484	In the hospital?	16
6485	Iodine contrast.	16
6486	is that Foreman?	16
6487	Is it a spatula?	16
6488	Lived on my own.	16
6489	Lungs ready yet?	16
6490	Let me see them.	16
6491	Lightheadedness?	16
6492	It's the autumn.	16
6493	Jude's cemetery.	16
6494	It was a tactic.	16
6495	It was elevated.	16
6496	It was my fault.	16
6497	It was the clot.	16
6498	It was the heat.	16
6499	It's a bathroom.	16
6500	It's a hospital.	16
6501	I was trying to.	16
6502	I'm not worried.	16
6503	IgA nephropathy.	16
6504	I--I was scared.	16
6505	I smell empathy.	16
6506	Oh, that's fine.	16

6517	No, I was wrong.	16
6518	Mr.Chips drools.	16
6519	Mitchell Gordon?	16
6520	Not interesting.	16
6521	Not necessarily.	16

6532	She always does.	16
6533	She is pregnant.	16
6534	She managed him.	16
6535	She went for it.	16
6536	She's giving up.	16
6537	She's not weird.	16
6538	I had a thought.	16
6539	I had an affair.	16
6540	I had no choice.	16
6541	I have diabetes.	16
6542	I found nodules.	16
6543	How's it coming?	16
6544	I left the room.	16
6545	I meant the kid.	16
6546	I miss Claudine.	16
6547	I need $200,000.	16
6548	I need pressure.	16
6549	I need to think.	16
6550	How do you mean?	16
6551	How you feeling?	16
6552	How did he look?	16
6553	Higher or lower?	16
6554	His son is dead.	16
6555	I can't drop it.	16
6556	I accepted that.	16
6557	Got him in here.	16
6558	I don't know, I.	16
6559	Former, to both.	16
6560	He just woke up.	16
6561	He played poker.	16
6562	He was negative.	16
6563	Heather Sweeney.	16
6564	He'll back down.	16
6565	Hello, good sir.	16
6566	Get 'em in here.	16
6567	Give me my kids.	16
6568	He's still sick.	16
6569	Good to operate.	16
6570	He's a coworker.	16
6571	He's my husband.	16
6572	He's not better.	16
6573	Capture my eyes.	16
6574	Changed my mind.	16
6575	Cheap polyester.	16
6576	Chest pain back?	16
6577	Children mostly.	16
6578	Callie's mother.	16
6579	Cancer can wait.	16
6580	did you do that?	16
6581	Do you know him?	16
6582	Does he hate me?	16
6583	Don't apologize.	16
6584	Don't be insane.	16
6585	And every night.	16
6586	And great vests.	16
6587	And if you live?	16
6588	And so did Drew.	16
6589	And the seventh?	16
6590	A terrible idea.	16
6591	12 hours a week.	16
6592	All right, what?	16
6593	And there it is.	16
6594	Been in surgery.	16
6595	Aplastic anemia.	16
6596	April Donaldson.	16
6597	Are you in pain?	16
6598	$20, $1 million.	16
6599	We're separated.	16
6600	What about both?	16
6601	What about HTLV?	16
6602	Vertebral clear.	16
6603	We can fix that.	16
6604	Wait right here.	16
6605	What did he eat?	16
6606	We'll know soon.	16
6607	Well, how about.	16
6608	What went wrong?	16
6609	Vasculitis fits.	16
6610	What five grand?	16
6611	What, that's it?	16
6612	What's going on?	16
6613	Why do you care?	16
6614	Where's Cofield?	16
6615	The nurses talk.	16
6616	The rest of you.	16
6617	Then what is it?	16
6618	That'll confirm.	16
6619	Two to the head.	16
6620	Stress test too.	16
6621	This is America.	16
6622	This just feels.	16
6623	You're pregnant.	16
6624	What's the plan?	16
6625	You were saying?	16
6626	You're this way.	16
6627	Yes, absolutely.	16
6628	You always were.	16
6629	You brought him.	16
6630	You feel jilted.	16
6631	You got stabbed.	16
6632	You have a gift.	16
6633	You killed more?	16
6634	I have no idea.	15
6635	Everybody lies.	15
6636	I'll take Taub.	15
6637	What explosion?	15
6638	You were right.	15
6639	Vascular clamp.	15
6640	He's not wrong.	15
6641	How'd you know?	15
6642	Take your time.	15
6643	It's a symptom.	15
6644	It's Burkitt's.	15
6645	It's his heart.	15
6646	It's his liver.	15
6647	It's not lupus.	15
6648	It's not naive.	15
6649	I'm too little.	15
6650	Inject the dye.	15
6651	Invasive strep.	15
6652	It ain't there.	15
6653	It could be TB.	15
6654	Is it neomycin?	15
6655	Is long QT bad?	15
6656	Kinda like now.	15
6657	Martin Brodeur.	15
6658	Maternity ward.	15
6659	Just one thing.	15
6660	It makes sense.	15
6661	It was a prank.	15
6662	It was perfect.	15
6663	It's a one-off.	15
6664	I was thinking.	15
6665	I'll shoot you.	15
6666	I'm a murderer.	15
6667	I'm also sorry.	15
6668	I'm not joking.	15
6669	I'll be around.	15
6670	I want a steak.	15
6671	No, you're not.	15
6672	Oh, okay, then.	15

6695	No, you didn't.	15
6696	Rupert Murdoch?	15
6697	Pretty perfect.	15
6698	Sex is healthy.	15
6699	She'll be fine.	15
6700	She's negative.	15
6701	She's vomiting.	15
6702	She's your mom.	15
6703	I dyed it back.	15
6704	I didn't do it.	15
6705	I looked it up.	15
6706	I love you too.	15
6707	I miss him too.	15
6708	I need Insulin.	15
6709	How could this.	15

6759	Their husbands.	15
6760	That was great.	15

6782	You look tired.	15
6783	You must be Dr.	15
6784	It's unlikely.	14
6785	You're an ass.	14
6786	What happened?	14
6787	Wait a minute.	14
6788	And then what?	14
6789	Don't tell me.	14
6790	I am so sorry.	14
6791	No, you won't.	14
6792	Like, forever?	14
6793	It's not real.	14

6808	It's too late.	14
6809	Just got this.	14
6810	Just hurry up.	14
6811	It is a thing.	14
6812	It never took.	14
6813	It was a gift.	14
6814	It was stupid.	14
6815	I'm all right.	14
6816	I'm just done.	14
6817	I'm not angry.	14
6818	I thought so ?	14
