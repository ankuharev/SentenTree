1	Just knowing you're there for me is enough.	10998
2	No, you're right-- I really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff! The stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.	8613
3	Given what's happened, it's understandable that your opinion would color your testimony, but I just want to know what you said, what you did, and what you were thinking at the time.	8582
4	It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.	8351
5	How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.	8214
6	you're still on my mind you're still on my mind I can't see you but I know you're here I know you're here I know you're here I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time I'm glad you changed your mind.	8093
7	The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.	7907
8	Making this yet another interaction with you it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.	7792
9	And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo.	7699
10	What were you thinking?	7392
11	And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.	7330
12	If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?	7318
13	And your eyes-- the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.	7263
14	She has the right to know! It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.	7245
15	No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.	7207
16	So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.	7189
17	Could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.	7186
18	Get your hands off me.	7180
19	Wanting to build a connection with your dad and pass on some of the joy that he gave you, that's not stupid at all.	7170
20	And you can tell Taub that he's gonna get the same treatment as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.	7091
21	And I need a transplant, and they say I don't have much time, so when I heard that you were willing, I just.	7087
22	So when I see symptoms magically show up right when you need them-- And I was your boss for seven years.	7071
23	Bob Harris, get on up here with that beautiful family of yours! Bob Harris, folks! Bob, your community activism, charity work, and character represent the finest Cedarville has to offer.	7040
24	If Foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes, coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.	7039
25	That's what I always said to you, Callie, but I had a problem-- I'm nothing like you! Tell them to do the surgery.	6994
26	And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail-- That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun.	6990
27	Your job is to be his friend, to stay here and sit with him and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.	6979
28	Either your relationship just blows up like every other non-magical romance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.	6970
29	The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one.	6946
30	I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.	6941
31	I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word.	6913
32	You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it because then with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor because I'd think I could control you.	6846
33	Now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation.	6810
34	Sometimes, the best way to connect with someone is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.	6769
35	All this time I've been blind to this waking life now I see it everywhere 'cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince yeah and I'm taking it one day at a time Hey.	6697
36	Foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard.	6690
37	They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row but you know you don't have to you can just say no Okay.	6690
38	Then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.	6683
39	Of course I do, but this is about your daughter too and I'm not gonna do something like this without your support.	6675
40	Your drinking wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.	6658
41	If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.	6586
42	And you're here in my heart Like when I gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.	6569
43	Okay, and I'm sure you're a nice person, but I just moved from Atlanta, and it's my first time at this gym, so definitely don't know who this Taub guy is, but I already agree.	6542
44	Your shoes-- a different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal.	6455
45	Can you dispute the possibility that, had you visited the patient sooner, maybe talked to the wife, been directed to one of the students, that this case might have ended very differently?	6437
46	I can't decide whether to take out an I told you so ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.	6431
47	On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough to get diabetes even without him.	6380
48	I may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications, it might be a good time to come clean to your son, let his father visit.	6353
49	I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.	6347
50	You don't think I knew House was gonna tell you to ignore me and not do the ultrasound?	6335
51	You told the mom something you want to believe because you don't want to believe that this girl might be doing fine parent-free.	6286
52	You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.	6275
53	Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends to pretend I have a life, when all I did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom, miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.	6265
54	And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological-- Your parents didn't love you enough.	6261
55	My theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.	6251
56	We know there are some issues there, but your bone marrow could cure him.	6243
57	Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.	6236
58	If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.	6225
59	And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.	6221
60	This is what you said you wanted, but you're actually more upset now that her husband knows.	6194
61	Now, I love you and all, my brother, but not as much as I love my gang of crazy, roided-out Nazi bitches.	6188
62	That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching Martin Brodeur shut out the Rangers.	6187
63	Did you and the defendant spend the evening of October 8th watching the Devils game on TV, or did you just read about the game in the Chronicle while concocting this false alibi?	6186
64	It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to China.	6174
65	There is a way that you can get your money back.	6161
66	And then what happened?	6154
67	You haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word loyalty, which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty.	6132
68	If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.	6124
69	Yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea, you know, with us working together.	6100
70	Because he sees insecurity, and when House senses weakness, he pounces, and because his insecurity is the fact that other people can have faith and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.	6099
71	All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.	6095
72	Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.	6089
73	Half the time you bring your cars into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.	6084
74	The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing! I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.	6083
75	The fact that she didn't burst into tears tells me that you never thought he was your dad.	6082
76	If I were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, I would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way and-- Sorry.	6072
77	I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees-- You know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.	6068
78	At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.	6064
79	You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.	6049
80	The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.	6043
81	Gotta build and destroy then rebuild and destroy oh, I'm gonna build, build, build destroy then rebuild and destroy Why am I watching you cut your hair?	6040
82	You know, I'm sure you're a nice person and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into, but, really, I'm not interested.	6038
83	What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?	6012
84	Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and never write with?	6011
85	If you weren't wrestling with this, I'd say there's something really wrong with you.	5999
86	It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin.	5997
87	I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong.	5984
88	Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.	5982
89	You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes ?	5976
90	What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.	5971
91	Working in prison, you learned criminals rarely target random strangers, and you've got more money than you know what to do with, so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.	5960
92	Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?	5954
93	I didn't put that there! You're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch! What?	5944
94	Is that your hand near her nether regions?	5938
95	You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house and then fled the country for three months.	5937
96	Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here, I'd never find it because you are more devious-- - Clever.	5935
97	And you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.	5933
98	You hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.	5921
99	which she'll prove when her parents show up and you start protecting her from them.	5915
100	'Cause if it's the same as yesterday you know I'm out just so you know because, because our paths, they cross Dad.	5910
101	I mean, do you think my father would have done that for ten minutes?	5902
102	You know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.	5902
103	And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait.	5890
104	our paths, they cross mm-mm yesterday was hard on all of us on all of us == sync, corrected by If you don't know how to use a computer, we will teach you here.	5880
105	You chose me because you thought I'd have your back and I'd think twice about making a decision that would get you fired.	5879
106	Son of a bitch! Get away from them! House, House! It's a genetic condition! - Shut up! - Genetic! Your father has the gene.	5868
107	You're done here, just like every other place you've ever set foot in your life.	5864
108	Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.	5856
109	What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.	5856
110	House actually presented the case in that way, or are you just trying to make him look bad?	5849
111	You knew the second you told me about this case that I'd get involved.	5848
112	And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing?	5845
113	In the middle of a procedure that could basically save your life, House is actually trying to drag people away?	5843
114	If all you do is physical therapy and your nighttime version of it, you'll lose your mind faster than you regain those fine motor skills.	5837
115	After you'd administered the Heparin, I see there was a discharge order on the chart, and yet the patient never left.	5826
116	Either you're getting her gifts because you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you, or you're getting her gifts to screw with her.	5821
117	If I ever see you in here again, I will write you up, and they will revoke your parole.	5820
118	No, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one.	5813
119	You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood, and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks I caught in my teeth.	5804
120	Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.	5803
121	But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time.	5781
122	You made nice-nice with Phil, you decided that he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.	5738
123	No! No! No! Get the cup! Get the cup! Just drink it! Drink it! No! Grab the cup! Hands behind your back.	5737
124	This is the only way you're gonna get your answer.	5729
125	Only so many hours you can cry and bang on the door before you give up, find something to read.	5724
126	Whatever the reason, it boils down to the fact that you may never walk again because House created an atmosphere that promotes recklessness.	5723
127	You don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife, not unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.	5712
128	This check is for significantly more than what I told you it would take to fund the department.	5711
129	Why don't you check his vaccination record before you make another stupid.	5710
130	'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.	5709
131	This kidney thing is the only evidence you have that he's sick.	5704
132	I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.	5681
133	Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training.	5677
134	And there's your new team.	5665
135	You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or-- You're confusing me with the clinic again.	5659
136	In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.	5658
137	I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for China.	5653
138	There are hundreds of people who would do that for you.	5649
139	You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.	5626
140	You gotta push her neuroses to the point where even she thinks that she's crazy.	5616
141	You skipped over the actual DDX, and now you're averting your eyes.	5612
142	You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman.	5599
143	But if we can wake up and learn that the entire bank system has gone bankrupt overnight, it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk.	5599
144	Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.	5592
145	What you're headed towards now, 14 hours a day in silent prayer, never having a family, never touching another human being.	5590
146	By your own admission, if you give the patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.	5589
147	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== as the new dean of medicine, I'd like to personally welcome all of our new employees and ask, why the hell do you want to come back?	5588
148	Praise for the singing praise for the morning praise for them springing Are you at least gonna call the cops this time?	5576
149	I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with.	5565
150	Telecast, we expect an electric atmosphere in the arena and a sellout crowd of about 10,000 for Rubio versus Santos, two great fighters with illustrious careers who might have been expected to meet a long time ago.	5546
151	But then you'll get out, and unlike you.	5539
152	Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a patient into being tested is completely unethical.	5532
153	The artery that's bringing blood to your brain, it's coming apart.	5518
154	You're increasing the odds of that every second we waste here.	5515
155	The test is designed to determine if you're-- No, I mean your running a test and discharging me.	5515
156	Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you to let the guys know I'm not gonna be able to play on Saturday.	5509
157	A few years of therapy-- Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?	5506
158	Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.	5504
159	Because no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance, you didn't buy it either.	5504
160	But I know that all of you know him as the guy that owns the only gas station in town.	5499
161	There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip.	5495
162	If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.	5492
163	But House doesn't and I don't, so you can wait till he camps out on your parents' lawn or you can admit you don't live on some higher plane and thank me later.	5485
164	You were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.	5479
165	Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved.	5475
166	Interesting that you never showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer.	5467
167	If you think you're up to this job, it's time to lose them.	5466
168	I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh?	5463
169	But if you're having doubts about Chicago, I can call them back.	5456
170	Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr.	5455
171	Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.	5440
172	Either way, it's more interesting than whatever you're doing now.	5439
173	Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or because there is no new girl.	5437
174	I'm getting by by the way it's you on my mind Would you like to get a drink sometime after work?	5433
175	How about you have one of your peeps on the outside send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?	5432
176	You implied that all would have been fine otherwise.	5417
177	You're about to withdraw from the world for good.	5397
178	Oh, my God! We need help in here! - Go! - And they're off! You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?	5395
179	Getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board.	5387
180	Until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was.	5386
181	Which is why you're not gonna live there either.	5369
182	If he thinks this is the only way to help your patient.	5358
183	You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle.	5357
184	But let me be clear-- you mouth off to one guard, we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell, you break any rules I don't even remember, you can park your ass here for four more months.	5356
185	So you just ran away, lived with friends, and partied with guys that you knew your parents would hate.	5353
186	I'd say I'm in the book, but not the one you'll be reading from now on.	5352
187	And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr.	5346
188	that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our patient.	5345
189	Because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.	5343
190	Simon Harris filmed the whole thing on his camera phone and posted it on YouTube.	5339
191	If it fails, then you will actually have proven that you can control me.	5322
192	You know, that can happen when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.	5318
193	Which is why you should accept his apology and come back on the team.	5317
194	You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.	5315
195	Hands behind your head! On the ground! You are so lucky.	5307
196	Yet you were never anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison.	5297
197	I mean, you'll escalate, and then I'll retaliate, and the cycle will continue until we've both gone too far, at which point, I'll.	5294
198	You drove all the way out here just to tell us what you already told us.	5293
199	You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds, and he was carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.	5284
200	Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.	5280
201	House has established that that's okay in his world, or his prank war distracted you, or House makes medicine a game, and you just wanted to beat him.	5278
202	Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! [Foy Vance's Be the Song] And when you run This is Mark Sanchez.	5270
203	Just because that's what you'd miss the most.	5268
204	In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town-- ladling kittens, spaying soup.	5264
205	Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy, and I will give you your money.	5263
206	Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.	5263
207	I'm smiling because, for the last 12 hours, I've been picturing you with orange hair.	5260
208	And then when you got tired of being a rebel, you just went home.	5258
209	And some of you may know him as the treasurer of our harvest scholarship fund.	5254
210	Followed your advice and took the night off.	5254
211	Can't take me down You know, there's a bunch of us going to happy hour after work.	5252
212	If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?	5244
213	There is something in this world you are undeniably great at.	5243
214	And that you were the reason.	5242
215	I know this is hard, and I'm sorry about your wife.	5238
216	But it must've been important that you stayed for both of them.	5237
217	The first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment.	5219
218	The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot.	5219
219	someone who's related to you, does that empirically make them more special?	5218
220	You can't go to their house without Foreman's permission.	5209
221	Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.	5207
222	I heard about your conversation with the patient's daughter.	5205
223	I gave you time, Leeway, and you decided to do whatever the hell you wanted.	5202
224	She gave her notice the day after your incident.	5202
225	Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.	5194
226	You just said you wanted to increase the steroids, and now you want to just-- - I changed my mind.	5176
227	Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.	5175
228	Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a szechuan beef.	5175
229	You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.	5174
230	He comes in with 11 straight knockout wins and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook was able to cut Rubio over the right eye in the tenth round of that last fight.	5170
231	I didn't even know you could do this! Start the blood thinners.	5159
232	Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! How do you keep doing the same thing over and over with the same level of enthusiasm?	5155
233	I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.	5146
234	Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.	5143
235	The plasmapheresis hasn't had time to work, but TTP is our most likely-- Okay, I'm just-- I have to go look for him.	5141
236	You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.	5138
237	How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?	5135
238	Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee.	5134
239	It should open up the airways and buy you some time until the lungs are ready.	5132
240	There are 70,000 people in this country on the active waiting list for a kidney, and less than 10,000 dead people a year to give them one.	5128
241	We were talking about how you got the abrasions on your knees.	5124
242	Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with, they've moved on.	5122
243	I thought I was here to treat the patients, not entertain you.	5121
244	If you'd have seen some of the kitchens or the processing plants I have, you'd cook all your own food too.	5120
245	I vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour celebrating your freedom, justified, of course, by some absurd theory connecting it to donor.	5119
246	If you hadn't been screwing with me and put the idea in my head.	5119
247	I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.	5118
248	I consider these grounds to be a holy place, and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.	5115
249	We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?	5113
250	If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist.	5110
251	The whole town knows that you're in the hospital.	5110
252	You see what the patient says about drug use when her mother's out of the room.	5110
253	If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.	5108
254	My father, but-- His place or yours?	5100
255	And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.	5095
256	It's not the place to exorcise your guilt.	5085
257	When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just.	5081
258	Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.	5078
259	You know, I just got off the phone with some investors.	5074
260	You really like the idea, or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?	5059
261	I'll watch the baby again, and you can get a real night's sleep.	5054
262	I'm ju reading the notes on your desk.	5054
263	No, the part where he said that baby doesn't need you.	5052
264	They decided that your being stabbed.	5048
265	And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that.	5039
266	Even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.	5038
267	If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.	5034
268	You're the one who brought Andrews in.	5033
269	Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it.	5032
270	While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.	5031
271	Don't worry, I know you're not the relationship type.	5027
272	And the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.	5026
273	It was just your misinterpretation of them.	5018
274	You can recognize that your patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom.	5017
275	Do you know any of the kids at the party with your son?	5014
276	You can't, and neither can I.	5010
277	You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from ever intervening, even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.	5010
278	I can't go back there! You may have a fungal infection.	5009
279	Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry-- I didn't do anything wrong.	5008
280	Sometimes, you just don't get the job, but.	5000
281	Because for some patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication.	4999
282	I'll get the car and meet you out front.	4995
283	And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun.	4993
284	If your own kids are a scheduling item, maybe you should let one of them move.	4993
285	Before we proceed any further, Doctor, I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure you intend to perform on the remains.	4989
286	I don't want to let House sabotage himself by sabotaging me, and I need your guidance and your trust to do that.	4987
287	Not only was there a gut tuck, nose tuck, and arse tuck, but her new, fake norks stick out like nuts on a mutt.	4986
288	You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there.	4981
289	You'd rather have House fire you than Foreman?	4976
290	So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was-- Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter.	4968
291	Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.	4968
292	I'm not the man you thought I was.	4968
293	You took the first deal they offered you, because you wanted to punish yourself.	4967
294	The transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.	4966
295	That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland.	4961
296	You knew that your patient was at risk for a psychotic break when you brought a scalpel within his reach.	4958
297	If he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the X-ray to do the autopsy.	4951
298	Just can't stand to think of all those patients going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work.	4948
299	Sorry to mess with your world view, but I'm not messed up, so my parents couldn't have messed me up.	4947
300	Why a man in your position, with your abilities, is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.	4946
301	Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.	4934
302	Are you saying that because you believe it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?	4927
303	And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?	4921
304	How do you know about my first kid-- Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.	4921
305	Don't you think it's a little early to be dragging up our baggage in front of each other?	4919
306	You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt.	4913
307	Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister.	4909
308	If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here, you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.	4907
309	Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something.	4907
310	If you don't mind paying a fortune in child support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.	4905
311	When your dad showed up unexpectedly, House have a hand in that?	4904
312	I got a call saying-- I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid.	4902
313	You're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.	4901
314	I'm not lost I'm just looking for the prince and I'm taking it one step at a time and I'm getting by  	4899
315	You torched, nuked, and salted the earth with them.	4892
316	The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.	4882
317	Confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him and then completely forgot about it.	4880
318	! We have a little problem here! I need backup, I need backup! Alvarez! Mendelson! Sullivan! Mendelson! You're gonna pay for this.	4876
319	Your patients love you because you're empathetic.	4869
320	I know I'm not any good at being a clown yet, but when I do get a laugh and see those kids' eyes light up, that's how my dad made me feel when I was a kid.	4858
321	The legendary night on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.	4858
322	We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.	4851
323	Foreman, members of the committee, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today, I.	4851
324	What about juice boxes in the break room for the children you'll be hiring?	4849
325	I'm sorry the first time I had both of you together I had to wk.	4849
326	It's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.	4847
327	Weathers, I am sure you're right, but we need to be thorough.	4846
328	And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.	4838
329	And that's what you took away from this situation?	4838
330	If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.	4837
331	The good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.	4832
332	You're trying to score points with him at the risk of a patient's life.	4828
333	I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.	4828
334	That fire, the bruise on your face.	4827
335	I didn't want you and the kids to worry.	4825
336	Whatever test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.	4821
337	Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.	4821
338	You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.	4819
339	So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head.	4818
340	Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.	4808
341	As long as you keep dealing with your doubts in the same way then.	4804
342	You probably wouldn't want to have sex with them.	4803
343	But when you think about the consequences-- Okay, let's go.	4800
344	He has Alzheimer's! It's freezing outside, and he's sick! I mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?	4795
345	You're the reason I'm out of the big house.	4793
346	You mentioned your car was in the shop.	4792
347	Which means I wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week by child locking all my cabinets, padding table corners, and getting rid of every single magazine.	4791
348	See, the beauty of the plan is that if it works, you think you can control me.	4785
349	But you know what the rules are.	4782
350	If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor.	4780
351	Your bigger problem is, the people who design those things aren't idiots.	4780
352	I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday, and I saw everyone else move into the living room.	4779
353	And neither should you.	4778
354	Then why are you doing this?	4777
355	I'm betting on them both being yours.	4771
356	You said that 9:00 was the premium slot.	4771
357	I'm betting on the last one.	4768
358	But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.	4767
359	Nothing! You can't prove otherwise.	4767
360	Because you're not gonna be able to breathe.	4767
361	You think that's gonna last through the ages?	4764
362	No, it was just something I'd been thinking about and I figured, what the heck?	4762
363	Despite what the media would have us believe, you think we live in a very safe world.	4759
364	Many of our clients have struggled with addiction, and, if you want to get clean, we'll help you do that.	4757
365	You think you should kill yourself if you become a burden to the people who love you?	4757
366	I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I-- we're too busy for rationalizations.	4756
367	This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter y.	4753
368	Personally, I applaud your decision to step down off your cross and get on with your life, but your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.	4750
369	I need you to solve this, and I need you to do it without making me look like I can't control you.	4749
370	If it was an allergic reaction, the Corticosteroids and Epinephrine would have made him better, not worse.	4745
371	You think it's the end of the world, but you wanted kids.	4740
372	You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.	4739
373	You do know I punched the last person that pissed me off?	4738
374	House took your results after he manipulated you into providing them.	4736
375	Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died and who's still scared he may not walk.	4732
376	If you had actually been in the room, questioning the patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.	4726
377	The fourth thing you said was, where's my old environment?	4725
378	You forced me to go with the options here.	4724
379	You don't remember your father.	4722
380	All you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.	4716
381	The good news is, made me realize that you were right.	4715
382	I know, which means you can't go either.	4714
383	You could probably just hide the porn in your underwear drawer.	4711
384	Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?	4708
385	You're not working for House anymore, which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.	4703
386	He's got a point, but I'll let you make the call.	4703
387	Probably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.	4702
388	In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?	4700
389	It's like you getting two women pregnant at the same time.	4699
390	Is there someone you want me to call?	4697
391	I assume you dosed the patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?	4696
392	Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.	4695
393	But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?	4693
394	Your patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?	4691
395	I think you're right about the strep.	4687
396	Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice to maximize their niceness?	4683
397	The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up.	4680
398	He smacked his head against the wall.	4680
399	So you do realize that it is unacceptable to hit someone in the workplace?	4679
400	This is how you plan to get to the boxing game?	4678
401	I had Sophie again last night and Ruby slept in my guest room, which has nothing to do with Phil, who will never be a father to my children.	4675
402	I have no idea what flavor you are, so I decided to cover the spread.	4664
403	The food that you're eating to stop making you sick is making you sick.	4664
404	I think your symptoms are the result of alcohol abuse.	4662
405	Are you sure there's no one on the father's side of the family?	4660
406	Neither have you-- Analyze it however you like.	4659
407	You know what else doesn't show up in the blood work?	4658
408	Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility.	4658
409	And old team for the win! Not that I'm keeping score.	4654
410	[Schuyler Fisk's Waking Life] There's an anchor that's pulling on my heart and it's deep in the water - Hey.	4650
411	I think you're a good person and a fine doctor, but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons.	4647
412	there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round You're fired.	4641
413	They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.	4639
414	Places where they send you You're trying to save me.	4638
415	Can you feel the sheets on your skin?	4631
416	Would you shut the blinds on your way out?	4631
417	You may not be aware of half the things you've done.	4629
418	I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words.	4626
419	You know what happened here better than anyone, and you've worked with Dr.	4623
420	Why don't you show Joseph where the visitor's lounge is?	4617
421	The condition being that you're employed by me at PPTH.	4616
422	There are very serious risks, but if we don't figure out what he has, we can't treat him at all.	4615
423	You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.	4611
424	Just because you hung up your lab coat for more money and a bigger office?	4611
425	Getting House out of prison is the biggest decision you've made as Dean of Medicine, right?	4610
426	I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job?	4610
427	If you ever hear me mention anything about wanting kids, please feel free to punch me in the liver.	4610
428	You're not gonna close the wound first?	4610
429	And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right.	4608
430	You know, the down vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy.	4603
431	Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.	4603
432	Ben, you keep your grades up, you can do anything in the world.	4603
433	You know that close to 1% of the population identifies as asexual?	4602
434	You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with grammy Adams or cousin Itt.	4595
435	You open the door I want to be understanding.	4594
436	Foreman will find out you're taking this case, and he'll bust you.	4593
437	Is there some problem with the prescription you gave me?	4593
438	What the hell are you doing here?	4590
439	Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?	4589
440	What do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?	4586
441	If you'd like to talk to someone, we do have grief counselors at the hospital.	4584
442	Please accept this on behalf of all of us and know that we love you.	4583
443	You came to the hospital with beer in your pocket.	4579
444	They only come out when you're afraid or anxious.	4576
445	I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.	4575
446	You-- you understand them.	4575
447	If you're a match, but to increase our odds, we'd like to get your friends and faly tested as well.	4573
448	Yes, and-- and then you die.	4570
449	I'll let you know when we have the results.	4567
450	Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.	4561
451	To give you the excitement you need so you don't go looking for it.	4559
452	Can you-- - I don't know how to use the program.	4557
453	You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands.	4556
454	We can also provide clothes for the interview if you need them.	4551
455	Because of his heart problems, but-- Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.	4550
456	Just tell me your initial theory.	4545
457	You may remember me from the time I saved your life.	4541
458	I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the patient.	4541
459	Adams! They're gonna revoke your parole.	4539
460	If you're right, calcium channel blocker the lungs have no nervous system.	4537
461	You do understand the meaning of the word confirm.	4536
462	You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.	4533
463	Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.	4531
464	How many times have you thrown the truth in people's faces?	4527
465	You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here.	4525
466	You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.	4525
467	Then we have to assume liver failure is just another symptom of whatever she's got.	4523
468	They hurt all your bits.	4523
469	You--you hope you're wrong for the sake of the patient?	4521
470	I actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes .	4519
471	So a few people are nice to you, and your first thought is, Hmm, this seems strange ?	4518
472	They just don't like you.	4516
473	His symptoms will go away and then I can show him he was never sick.	4509
474	She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago-- what about dengue fever?	4508
475	Could be your not-so-subtle way of implying this was House's fault.	4506
476	The advantage of fake prescriptions is, you don't have to be a real doctor to write one.	4506
477	And you said the Devils won?	4500
478	What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?	4497
479	You think I'm not-- you think I'm not gonna go to Foreman with this?	4496
480	You don't think that will piss off your cellie even more when he figures it's a different bug?	4495
481	You're so happy with your life you've got nothing better to do at midnight than to come back into work to yell at me?	4494
482	You've only got her a couple days a week and most of that's spent with a rotating cast of nurses.	4493
483	Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.	4491
484	When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?	4489
485	Because you realize they're not dull.	4483
486	You're either preparing to fight Pacquiao or you're having one heck of a bad day.	4483
487	If you want an accurate patient history, don't ever talk to the patient.	4481
488	So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat.	4480
489	And I'm sure your tests have come up negative, or you would have shut me up already.	4477
490	Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.	4477
491	So why don't you do the smart thing here?	4472
492	My husband saw you in the clinic.	4472
493	Oh, a sudden collapse at your age can indicate a deterioration of the heart muscle.	4462
494	And the nurses love you.	4461
495	I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.	4457
496	I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.	4454
497	You could still pass the gene onto your children.	4448
498	And you can't know because you can't think clearly about her.	4444
499	You know, don't send out the marines.	4442
500	Brown Vestments means you're Carmelites, cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.	4440
501	Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.	4437
502	If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom never took him to a dermatologist?	4434
503	Have you sent the committee a character reference for me?	4433
504	Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.	4431
505	But if you feel the need to manipulate me to make me feel useful, then yes.	4430
506	The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.	4428
507	We've got to get you back to the hospital right away.	4426
508	He's a minor, the mom's his guardian, and it's not even medically relevant.	4425
509	And I suspect that you've spent every minute since this has happened trying to answer that very question.	4420
510	I missed the fact that you were married.	4418
511	The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like not shtupping mommy after the divorce?	4416
512	These are your training wheels.	4415
513	Your Honor, may I submit the sports page from the New Jersey Chronicle on October 9th, 2011.	4415
514	Have you ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?	4409
515	You find another angle.	4407
516	The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.	4406
517	But if your get-House-out-of-jail-free experiment blows up in your face, it's not my job to get you out of it.	4405
518	Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club.	4402
519	Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, I assume that plagiarism is the new black.	4400
520	As long as I don't hear it directly from her, then I can hang on to hope that it's not true.	4396
521	Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz.	4388
522	This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist.	4385
523	You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?	4383
524	I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it.	4382
525	You're the one everyone dislikes.	4380
526	They missed your son's rash.	4379
527	But I don't think that's gonna change your opinion, because.	4375
528	Neither of you stepped out between periods, get beer, pick up a pizza?	4373
529	So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years.	4372
530	But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here.	4371
531	This is a real issue, and I have to worry about the big picture now.	4367
532	So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.	4367
533	Your Honor, may I submit the Chronicle sports page from October 10th?	4364
534	He told me had a few glasses of wine, and that he shouldn't do it, but he also said that you were good.	4362
535	You can't take the money, House.	4361
536	Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson.	4361
537	Running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents.	4360
538	Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more humanely.	4358
539	Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.	4357
540	Maybe you could tell your husband that we did.	4354
541	You add them all together, we get.	4354
542	Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever.	4351
543	You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio fight?	4351
544	You clearly wrote that after the fact.	4347
545	The wife said she was sure to clear the house for her husband's safety.	4347
546	And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.	4346
547	You must have broken into the wrong house.	4344
548	But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.	4340
549	You can't if you're not willing-- Just take care of yourself.	4337
550	'Cause your car is still in the shop.	4337
551	But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.	4328
552	I wouldn't be doing this if I thought there was another way.	4326
553	I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.	4322
554	The only evidence you have is proof of something else.	4322
555	Then why'd you lie about it?	4320
556	I know you're the better diagnostician.	4315
557	what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing problems?	4312
558	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you.	4312
559	You'll appreciate that I left the idiots subtextual.	4311
560	The fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her.	4304
561	To live, oh and I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds gets so hard in times like now to hold on but guns they wait to be stuck by Thirteen.	4298
562	I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning.	4296
563	The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.	4295
564	There's the two of you kissing over dinner.	4292
565	Yes, but we won't know what until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.	4290
566	You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my patient.	4288
567	We think that's why you passed out and couldn't move.	4287
568	I was a mess, and she just sat there like.	4284
569	You weren't even there.	4282
570	You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?	4282
571	Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy.	4282
572	Otherwise, you are equally to blame.	4280
573	Did you get all the Vicodin you needed?	4278
574	This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the patient.	4276
575	House liked poking ant hills with a stick when he was a kid, and now he wants to do the same with us.	4275
576	They're gonna charge you with extra crimes.	4273
577	You two know each other?	4273
578	Why should you have to spend the night?	4270
579	Where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose.	4268
580	You just think they're fun.	4266
581	Are you real or just something from wanderlust who can you trust when tears we flower House.	4264
582	I told you, I was sitting at my desk when the attack happened.	4263
583	I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.	4263
584	Right, like group homes, where you're packed in with as many messed-up delinquent kids as possible, foster parents who only take you in because you're a meal ticket.	4260
585	But you found a tear just below the esophagus.	4259
586	Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.	4259
587	I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your house.	4259
588	I didn't do anything! Next time I will take your stereo! Ow! That was stupid.	4258
589	The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.	4257
590	The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass.	4256
591	Can you get me an escort to gather samples?	4255
592	Imagine what would happen if there was a terrorist attack on the food supply or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.	4254
593	And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?	4253
594	But one of the only things that I can feel okay about is that I never hit her.	4249
595	Would you mind watching them for us?	4246
596	Could we go back on the record and get this over with?	4244
597	What were you doing when the pain came on?	4240
598	If Park is right, he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us, we can cross brain off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.	4238
599	fake an interest in them because you needed to, right?	4238
600	Your son Ben is in the hospital, at Princeton-Plainsboro.	4236
601	And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something.	4233
602	You already knew Andrews was drinking that night, didn't you?	4229
603	First 17 messages were cute, but-- I'm putting the band back together.	4228
604	Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey.	4227
605	which you might have, by the way.	4227
606	After 12 years, the active infection would have died down everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests.	4227
607	I could add some Mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.	4225
608	If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.	4219
609	I thought you'd rather see the company go under in New Jersey than thrive in China.	4218
610	There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.	4216
611	Your catheter bag is empty, despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.	4214
612	There really was nothing for him to do.	4213
613	want you to have them.	4212
614	And even if someone wanted to poison him, I don't see how they would do it.	4211
615	Actually there's two, but we don't have enough jell-o for the first.	4209
616	Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.	4208
617	Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	4207
618	We got the patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.	4204
619	I completely understand and almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine.	4203
620	But just do whatever you have to do to get over this.	4203
621	Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.	4202
622	If you really love them back, then.	4200
623	Well, you lied about the boyfriend.	4200
624	Bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms.	4199
625	So what do you think-- is the patient paranoid or am I?	4198
626	Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fever, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription.	4198
627	I prepared the sarcophagus for you.	4195
628	I get that you're scared and guilty.	4193
629	It's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.	4190
630	House noticed hormone levels in your blood, and consulted me as an oncologist.	4190
631	I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.	4188
632	That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.	4186
633	You have them DNA tested yet?	4186
634	What the hell are you doing?	4185
635	Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.	4177
636	You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.	4165
637	This whole thing was about your ankle monitor.	4163
638	You're allowed to be at the hospital.	4163
639	They get to just hang out and do nothing?	4156
640	He was getting revenge for the orange hair and rigged it in House's office.	4153
641	I've ruled out Wegener's, Berger's, heavy metal poison-- two trains are about to collide, and I'm trying to talk them out of it.	4150
642	I thought Park and Adams were both right but that their conclusions were both wrong.	4150
643	So you're saying I got the clap?	4147
644	If you're speaking as a team member, then I'd say you're a moron.	4146
645	If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine, then I'd say you're a moron.	4145
646	Do you mind unbuttoning your shirt and lying down for me?	4145
647	You need help with the lacerations?	4142
648	You said the game wasn't typical.	4140
649	And if they find out it was me, I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.	4140
650	I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really-- Oh, no, she could die.	4132
651	Can you believe she used to work in the can?	4132
652	Where did you unload the baby?	4132
653	I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting someone in my own family, like when my brother tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.	4131
654	Now she can't--there's no reason for us not to call.	4128
655	The self-defense classes, you think they're making any kind of difference?	4125
656	Is there some black market in Insulin that I don't know about?	4121
657	They said you were almost killed three weeks ago.	4116
658	His fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about GAD and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.	4112
659	Park, maybe you'll like to update our esteemed colleague on the condition of our patient.	4112
660	With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order.	4107
661	He yelled at you for letting me see the file?	4103
662	Short occlusion time of the artery, when the swelling goes down, you should.	4102
663	And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.	4101
664	I would just be you telling the truth.	4101
665	Morning! I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.	4100
666	You know, the least you could do is laugh at a dying lady's jokes.	4099
667	It's a little weird without the rash, but it fits all of his other symptoms.	4098
668	Y-you want to stop seeing each other?	4096
669	Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.	4096
670	And don't even pretend like you're not relieved.	4093
671	He broke out with a rash right after I tested with the wheat-allergy swab, but none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.	4090
672	I had the nails and eyebrows done, but that's it.	4086
673	So that must have been nice, having Ruby and the baby under one roof.	4085
674	Have you seen Bride of the Monster?	4082
675	We're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit and check back in two minutes.	4080
676	You could at least let her sleep in the room.	4080
677	You don't want to listen to me, then I don't want to listen to you.	4080
678	Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?	4077
679	Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night.	4073
680	You can look at the patient file if you want.	4070
681	Maybe not as much as this guy, but if people told nothing but the truth, the world would probably burn down overnight.	4070
682	And what about your idea?	4068
683	Did they tell you why?	4067
684	You're doing it to protect them.	4067
685	Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.	4066
686	I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.	4065
687	I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.	4065
688	Or are you just trying to avoid talking about why you don't like working with me?	4063
689	You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.	4060
690	Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second.	4057
691	She is there for him in the only way that matters now.	4056
692	Add that to some peripheral red-green confusion, puts my money-- excuse me, your money-- soon to be my money on a tumor near his pituitary.	4052
693	If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff.	4050
694	You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my patient is now in a coma.	4049
695	And now there's still something wrong with me.	4043
696	And that's just some of the lies from the last minute.	4042
697	There's a little mass here, and I'd like to get it checked out.	4042
698	Mom and dad were at each other's throats and the academic crisis was a cry for help.	4038
699	We'd like to perform an exercise test, re-create the stress that may have caused his symptoms.	4038
700	I can't justify buying video games and private schools when other people's children are starving.	4038
701	You got her the job interview.	4035
702	You wanna get back at these guys.	4034
703	I was giving you the gift of deniability.	4033
704	You have to have the treatment.	4033
705	Things don't seem small anymore, they-- I woke up from a nap and, uh, everything went from really small to really huge.	4031
706	I'd like to ask you about your grandson, Drew Lemaine.	4030
707	They'll lie, because if you knew.	4029
708	When's the last time you had a full night's sleep?	4027
709	He's your friend, and he's not well.	4027
710	What makes you-- Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes since this morning.	4026
711	You're blaming the wrong guy.	4021
712	But that's not the idea House went with.	4020
713	You applied for the job.	4019
714	No, he heard the nurses talking about her, that she was short on time.	4018
715	The American Associate of Rheumatology wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday, in Atlantic City.	4008
716	House, you're in here because you think you can do whatever you want whenever you want.	4005
717	Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help.	4000
718	I take it you're in the latter category.	4000
719	It stands to reason that your emotions factored in.	3998
720	It's not his spinal cord, it's the wiring between his heart and his brain.	3997
721	Next time, you could probably drop the undercover act.	3994
722	He makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience.	3989
723	Copying him makes you look pathetic.	3984
724	And you've always-- What's that from?	3983
725	Heart attack while he was on Interferon rules out encephalitis, but I still think I'm right about the neural symptoms.	3982
726	You have your own bathroom and office now.	3982
727	That's a pretty nice trophy, there, Andres.	3982
728	You're letting in the flies.	3978
729	Keep them stable as long as you can.	3977
730	You still never told me why you left the seminary.	3977
731	I assume you concur with the diagnosis.	3973
732	No offense, but, uh, I think it's terrible your dad's closing down all your American operations.	3964
733	Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl.	3964
734	You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.	3963
735	The Confederacy gave men $21 every six months-- - You poisoned us both.	3961
736	Are you now on the team?	3949
737	You're in the hospital.	3948
738	You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets.	3947
739	Either way, we don't get his temperature above 95, it's not going to matter.	3947
740	As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here.	3946
741	Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.	3946
742	Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.	3945
743	You show all the classic behaviors.	3942
744	I was just trying to protect him, like I should have done from the start.	3942
745	Oh, you think they're.	3941
746	You can't leave the hospital.	3940
747	Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam.	3940
748	You're protecting the girl.	3936
749	There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?	3935
750	This is a big one, and it's the premium slot.	3933
751	By definition, no class can teach you to expect them.	3933
752	And there's no way I'm leaving him here unsupervised.	3932
753	No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.	3932
754	You think he knows anything about women who don't want to have sex?	3929
755	Who the hell are you?	3928
756	Fresh from the word I need you to drive me to a doctor.	3927
757	You're in the medical profession?	3925
758	Kovalchuk had two, Arnott and Parise each had one, and Marty got the shutout.	3924
759	You're through the aorta.	3923
760	Code Grey! So your position is that your team's disobedience caused this?	3922
761	I thought you said that guy was one of your best doctors.	3920
762	The facts of this case, on the other hand-- the facts are in the file.	3920
763	You said you didn't anticipate their defiance.	3919
764	'Cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time - Hey.	3918
765	Do we owe this case to your guilt at having ignored your own forgetful mommy?	3918
766	Then why're you telling me?	3917
767	So you want twice as many of them disrespected?	3916
768	I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes! Chase and Adams can do the test.	3913
769	No! Male patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?	3913
770	Might be easier if you'd stay out of the room.	3912
771	Then don't believe her, and start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	3912
772	You do read the school paper, don't you?	3912
773	And you tested her-- see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.	3911
774	Didn't peg you as the midday fun kind of guy.	3910
775	You got the ending you wanted.	3908
776	Do you think getting beaten up, you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?	3907
777	That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is not surprisingly wrong.	3907
778	Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911, unless they said we were armed, it's low priority.	3906
779	My mom says he was a loving father but always broke and always on the road.	3904
780	And you're not sure if he has brain damage from being frozen.	3897
781	And I was the one who questioned her, so, if there was an oversight, it was mine.	3895
782	She wasn't even gonna leave her until I said that I was letting you off early.	3893
783	It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.	3893
784	And that's why men always marry their right hands.	3893
785	I'm going to assume this is another one.	3891
786	That's not what you wanted to tell her.	3889
787	Got you a Reuben from the cafeteria.	3888
788	This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.	3884
789	But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above.	3883
790	Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage.	3883
791	It's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.	3883
792	You hit, you make the call.	3883
793	My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.	3882
794	You ever see me chatting on the phone, taking visitors?	3881
795	The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.	3880
796	Same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you.	3870
797	They've given you a great home.	3869
798	Hey, did you know your ex-wife still lives right behind this place?	3868
799	Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.	3865
800	How'd the mom seem to you?	3865
801	Just tell him about your parents or make up a lie.	3865
802	You obviously lied about sex and this.	3863
803	Surprised you didn't go into the diplomatic corps.	3860
804	ICU stands for take your time in Latin.	3860
805	I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch, much less run around trying to recruit nurses for yours.	3859
806	The one asking me to bring you some dinner.	3859
807	You want to believe the mythical biological connection excuses being a man slut.	3857
808	Which one of you is the cheap bastard?	3854
809	No, there's not even a bottle of wite-out in this place.	3853
810	House, the nurses saw you come in.	3849
811	You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument.	3849
812	You talk to her, the bet is void.	3848
813	I'll--I'll bet some of them bore you.	3845
814	And yet your first thought was frostbite?	3844
815	Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now.	3844
816	And, for the first time, she's acting like it.	3842
817	Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.	3837
818	But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.	3837
819	You heard the calling?	3836
820	You were making it up to them.	3834
821	So you're zen about it but won't let go of your anger toward House?	3833
822	You say that like it's not gonna work.	3833
823	Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.	3832
824	And she was nagging you about finding a husband.	3831
825	Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting.	3827
826	If this is really about family, you will not do this.	3823
827	I'm an asset to this hospital, an asset you're about to lose to Chicago.	3822
828	Orgasms oxygenate the brain, lighting up over 30 different areas and making us forget how boring Susie Cooper is.	3819
829	If I had the power to veto him, given all the crap I've put up with over the years, don't know if I could use it objectively.	3819
830	You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement.	3815
831	You can cancel the hearing.	3811
832	A person experiences something that's too difficult to accept, so they create alternate personalities that don't have to accept it.	3810
833	So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?	3809
834	But you do know I just can't let this slide.	3804
835	And that probably leaves you as former Dean of Medicine.	3804
836	You remember the antibiotic they gave you?	3803
837	We get to stay here with the people who've been so loyal to this company.	3802
838	She can't share her problems with him, or plan for the future.	3798
839	The secretary said you were on leave.	3798
840	That's right, all those babies with aids, they're just using us.	3797
841	Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing in his office?	3797
842	I'm not doing this for you.	3796
843	You think my judgment's the least bit compromised?	3795
844	Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?	3793
845	Does a friend watch you where it's happening, and wonder why?	3791
846	So who do you blame, Dr.	3790
847	So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?	3789
848	You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.	3788
849	Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.	3785
850	It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.	3784
851	I can't discuss any of that, not before the hearing.	3781
852	And check with admitting for the net worth of all new patients.	3778
853	You don't like that I'm reassessing my life, that I want to change it, that I can.	3776
854	Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest man.	3773
855	Meanwhile, he's keeping you here searching for a plan that doesn't even exist.	3771
856	Would you please read the caption under the photo?	3770
857	And I'm not one of them.	3769
858	How are things between you and your wife?	3769
859	We're in the hospital.	3768
860	The wife shut down a floral company to stay home and feed him every meal he's had in the last four years.	3767
861	But the steroids would have treated for that.	3758
862	Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?	3758
863	The point is, I gave it to you, so we're even.	3757
864	If it's a synthetic problem, more fluid will leak into h chest and his heart will fail.	3757
865	Y-you mean the treatment will, um.	3750
866	What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?	3749
867	'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.	3749
868	And that was supposed to be the end of it.	3745
869	You had no right! This is none of your business! - I didn't.	3740
870	You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?	3740
871	Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.	3739
872	A patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use, and obviously you're under hoe and office arrest.	3734
873	Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.	3732
874	Couldn't stand to lose him as a patient, so you faked his symptom to prove you right.	3732
875	Wait until they take him back to his room--draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.	3730
876	Swelling that fast and localized has to come from the lymph nodes.	3727
877	The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks.	3722
878	And to wipe that out, you need special ops.	3721
879	You want me to return these?	3719
880	You missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors.	3717
881	I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment until you were certain I'd given up looking.	3716
882	A second ago, you wanted to run like hell, and now you want to look for secret passages?	3716
883	Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.	3714
884	But when I was told the patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.	3714
885	If there's even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.	3713
886	You've never done this before, have you?	3713
887	One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant, and we couldn't even get the kid a marrow match.	3712
888	I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.	3712
889	Our patient now has a mass in his neck, and his body temp's been rising over the last three hours.	3711
890	Wear them while you masturbate?	3710
891	You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub.	3710
892	I know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.	3710
893	As for Santos, his handlers tell us that he's done more roadwork than at any time in his career, hoping to prove tonight that he can box for 12 full rounds.	3709
894	We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late.	3708
895	When you saw the boy.	3708
896	You break the law, you go back to jail.	3707
897	This might be the last time I ever know what he's thinking.	3707
898	I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right.	3706
899	You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old patients was denied.	3701
900	I admit I was stuck, until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.	3699
901	And I don't want your help.	3699
902	You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.	3695
903	I hope, one day, they'll understand that.	3695
904	My parents have a lot of money, but they didn't make it legally.	3695
905	Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.	3693
906	When I left the room, he was telling her about the strippers from his bachelor party.	3691
907	If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick.	3690
908	My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.	3687
909	It was wrong of me to confront you about taking Rachel to Portland.	3682
910	Plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you.	3681
911	The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.	3678
912	Here's your five grand.	3678
913	You have to believe that every parent screws up every child or you were screwed out of a decent childhood.	3676
914	No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him.	3675
915	Two hours ago, I found this in your closet in a box with your name on it.	3675
916	This is about you covering your own ass.	3673
917	And by money, you mean all your money.	3669
918	I don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response, but, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's on Black Friday, I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.	3668
919	Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.	3668
920	And that haircut isn't helping, either.	3666
921	Maternal grandmother's worse than that.	3666
922	Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it.	3666
923	You the guy, the kidney donor?	3663
924	In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors.	3662
925	All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out.	3661
926	I'm glad you feel that way, because I do have a favor to ask.	3661
927	Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up.	3661
928	He keeps imagining symptoms, and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.	3660
929	You don't have to work for House, but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.	3657
930	I mean, even if you are right about it, why take your word over mine?	3657
931	And you want to take that away?	3651
932	And I look forward to working with you as well.	3650
933	One day I was in the park talking with another nanny.	3649
934	Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.	3649
935	And even if it did, they'd blame themselves for the rest of their lives too.	3647
936	You're bleeding through your bandage.	3643
937	And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.	3642
938	Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used.	3641
939	No wonder you're playing handsies with her.	3641
940	Do you have any medical justification for your diagnosis?	3639
941	Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me.	3637
942	You screwed up the lungs.	3636
943	That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.	3635
944	And you never would have operated on her after.	3635
945	He's threatening to show your husband.	3629
946	Well, you don't have a gun, but you do have my sunglasses, my tennis racket-- I can't imagine why-- Had to kill a mouse.	3628
947	Think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there.	3627
948	You envied their dysfunction?	3627
949	There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.	3620
950	The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart.	3615
951	Hope you practiced the immaculate contraception.	3615
952	Never said anything about the patient's husband.	3612
953	Or we'll go to the light box in the lab and know the truth once and for all.	3610
954	You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.	3609
955	Ow! I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise.	3609
956	it fits all of his symptoms and exains why he got worse after the steroids.	3608
957	So why didn't you want to go with her this morning?	3604
958	But, well, if it was something in the water, it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?	3604
959	Apparently, you were right about that one.	3602
960	No, but digging delusions out of your skin with dirty fingernails could cause both.	3602
961	I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.	3601
962	And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are.	3599
963	Flipd a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.	3598
964	you can get that without having sex?	3597
965	You really think I care about your car?	3596
966	Click the third tab from the left and find the box that says previous entries.	3596
967	And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.	3595
968	Then my dad got into narcotics, at first just selling but then using too, or he never would have gotten into the slave trade.	3591
969	Also, he started a betting pool on which kid is yours and which isn't.	3590
970	I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced Adams has parentally inflicted damage.	3588
971	I think that little of you and that much of me.	3587
972	There's plenty of time for that after the operation.	3587
973	Two of you go find her and find out what.	3583
974	I know about your deal with Adams.	3583
975	I--yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment, but, uh, I got a flat.	3583
976	You set the wheels in motion.	3579
977	With the Interferon his English should come back, and the aggression should subside.	3577
978	you already kn this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized.	3576
979	And why are you asking me about it?	3576
980	What would you think if you found out years later your beloved dead wife cheated on you?	3572
981	And now you're gonna tell me you didn't.	3571
982	If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.	3570
983	If marriage is feeding and cleaning someone, limiting conversations, to repeating a few simple commands, then I was married to my pet rat.	3570
984	You dropped in the U.	3569
985	I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.	3565
986	House can dance all over the rules, gets me knifed, and he gets a pass.	3565
987	'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering.	3564
988	The Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather.	3563
989	I want your stereo and your headphones.	3560
990	That last insult was your cue to leave.	3559
991	Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to probable.	3558
992	You really wanna turn your back on this guy?	3558
993	But some are physiological, and others are psychological.	3558
994	But when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.	3557
995	More than that, because you don't have an answer.	3554
996	Andrews is the one that should leave.	3552
997	I don't know the history, but everyone makes mistakes.	3551
998	You know, for someone who asks as many favors as you do, you sure don't make any effort to win me over.	3551
999	You haven't been that for two years.	3547
1000	You're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.	3547
