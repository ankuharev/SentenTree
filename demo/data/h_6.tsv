1	just knowing you're there for me is enough.	10998
2	no, you're right-- i really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff! the stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.	8613
3	given what's happened, it's understandable that your opinion would color your testimony, but i just want to know what you said, what you did, and what you were thinking at the time.	8582
4	it's not that i was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and i were at the beach this morning, and i noticed a rash on his left thigh.	8351
5	how could i comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.	8214
6	you're still on my mind you're still on my mind i can't see you but i know you're here i know you're here i know you're here i'm not lost just looking for the prince i'm taking it one step at a time i'm glad you changed your mind.	8093
7	the fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not i did the right thing.	7907
8	making this yet another interaction with you it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.	7792
9	and since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo.	7699
10	what were you thinking?	7392
11	and i assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in new jersey.	7330
12	if he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! so for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?	7318
13	and your eyes-- the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.	7263
14	she has the right to know! it's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.	7245
15	no, i'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.	7207
16	so either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.	7189
17	could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.	7186
18	get your hands off me.	7180
19	wanting to build a connection with your dad and pass on some of the joy that he gave you, that's not stupid at all.	7170
20	and you can tell taub that he's gonna get the same treatment as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.	7091
21	and i need a transplant, and they say i don't have much time, so when i heard that you were willing, i just.	7087
22	so when i see symptoms magically show up right when you need them-- and i was your boss for seven years.	7071
23	bob harris, get on up here with that beautiful family of yours! bob harris, folks! bob, your community activism, charity work, and character represent the finest cedarville has to offer.	7040
24	if foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes, coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.	7039
25	that's what i always said to you, callie, but i had a problem-- i'm nothing like you! tell them to do the surgery.	6994
26	and you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail-- that is actually not one of the many reasons that i don't own a gun.	6990
27	your job is to be his friend, to stay here and sit with him and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.	6979
28	either your relationship just blows up like every other non-magical romance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.	6970
29	the only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one.	6946
30	i'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.	6941
31	i'd call you idiots again, but at this point i'm starting to doubt whether you understand what i mean by the word.	6913
32	you knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it because then with my ego boosted, you thought i'd be in the mood to take off your monitor because i'd think i could control you.	6846
33	now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, i'm wearing pants, and i'm ignoring your first observation.	6810
34	sometimes, the best way to connect with someone is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.	6769
35	all this time i've been blind to this waking life now i see it everywhere 'cause i'm not lost just looking for the prince yeah and i'm taking it one day at a time hey.	6697
36	foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard.	6690
37	they'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row but you know you don't have to you can just say no okay.	6690
38	then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.	6683
39	of course i do, but this is about your daughter too and i'm not gonna do something like this without your support.	6675
40	your drinking wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.	6658
41	if you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.	6586
42	and you're here in my heart like when i gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.	6569
43	okay, and i'm sure you're a nice person, but i just moved from atlanta, and it's my first time at this gym, so definitely don't know who this taub guy is, but i already agree.	6542
44	your shoes-- a different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal.	6455
45	can you dispute the possibility that, had you visited the patient sooner, maybe talked to the wife, been directed to one of the students, that this case might have ended very differently?	6437
46	i can't decide whether to take out an i told you so ad in the new england journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.	6431
47	on the other hand, maybe you're fat enough to get diabetes even without him.	6380
48	i may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications, it might be a good time to come clean to your son, let his father visit.	6353
49	i gather from the silence that either you all agree with chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.	6347
50	you don't think i knew house was gonna tell you to ignore me and not do the ultrasound?	6335
51	you told the mom something you want to believe because you don't want to believe that this girl might be doing fine parent-free.	6286
52	you have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.	6275
53	like an idiot, i went out with my girlfriends to pretend i have a life, when all i did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom, miss the baby i couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.	6265
54	and your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological-- your parents didn't love you enough.	6261
55	my theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.	6251
56	we know there are some issues there, but your bone marrow could cure him.	6243
57	unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.	6236
58	if you kept him on them like i said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.	6225
59	and although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.	6221
60	this is what you said you wanted, but you're actually more upset now that her husband knows.	6194
61	now, i love you and all, my brother, but not as much as i love my gang of crazy, roided-out nazi bitches.	6188
62	that the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching martin brodeur shut out the rangers.	6187
63	did you and the defendant spend the evening of october 8th watching the devils game on tv, or did you just read about the game in the chronicle while concocting this false alibi?	6186
64	it says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to china.	6174
65	there is a way that you can get your money back.	6161
66	and then what happened?	6154
67	you haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word loyalty, which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty.	6132
68	if you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.	6124
69	yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea, you know, with us working together.	6100
70	because he sees insecurity, and when house senses weakness, he pounces, and because his insecurity is the fact that other people can have faith and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.	6099
71	all right, i admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.	6095
72	well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if i wanna check the returns policy.	6089
73	half the time you bring your cars into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.	6084
74	the bet's that i'll get fired after my hearing! i'll take that action too, but you're already a c-note in the hole.	6083
75	the fact that she didn't burst into tears tells me that you never thought he was your dad.	6082
76	if i were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, i would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way and-- sorry.	6072
77	i got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees-- you know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.	6068
78	at least as good as the other 12 times that i've called and paged you in the last three weeks.	6064
79	you're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.	6049
80	the facts say you should be suspended, which, from what i understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.	6043
81	gotta build and destroy then rebuild and destroy oh, i'm gonna build, build, build destroy then rebuild and destroy why am i watching you cut your hair?	6040
82	you know, i'm sure you're a nice person and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into, but, really, i'm not interested.	6038
83	what happened the last time another doctor told you i was wrong about a case?	6012
84	why do i need the pen that you always carry around and never write with?	6011
85	if you weren't wrestling with this, i'd say there's something really wrong with you.	5999
86	it's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin.	5997
87	i also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that andrews was wrong.	5984
88	unfortunately, the patuxent river naval air station was gps testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.	5982
89	you're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes ?	5976
90	what you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.	5971
91	working in prison, you learned criminals rarely target random strangers, and you've got more money than you know what to do with, so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.	5960
92	don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?	5954
93	i didn't put that there! you're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch! what?	5944
94	is that your hand near her nether regions?	5938
95	you drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house and then fled the country for three months.	5937
96	despite the fact that i know there's a gun in here, i'd never find it because you are more devious-- - clever.	5935
97	and you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.	5933
98	you hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.	5921
99	which she'll prove when her parents show up and you start protecting her from them.	5915
100	'cause if it's the same as yesterday you know i'm out just so you know because, because our paths, they cross dad.	5910
