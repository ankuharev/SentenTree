1	Just knowing you're there for me is enough.	10998
2	No, you're right-- I really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff! The stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.	8613
3	Given what's happened, it's understandable that your opinion would color your testimony, but I just want to know what you said, what you did, and what you were thinking at the time.	8582
4	It's not that I was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and I were at the beach this morning, and I noticed a rash on his left thigh.	8351
5	How could I comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.	8214
6	you're still on my mind you're still on my mind I can't see you but I know you're here I know you're here I know you're here I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time I'm glad you changed your mind.	8093
7	The fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not I did the right thing.	7907
8	Making this yet another interaction with you it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.	7792
9	And since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo.	7699
10	What were you thinking?	7392
11	And I assume you added that irrelevant tidbit because you're moved by the son's idiotic tribute and think it justifies keeping your daughter in New Jersey.	7330
12	If he has another attack and there isn't a doctor in the next cell, he could die! So for one second, will you stop covering your ass and do the test?	7318
13	And your eyes-- the only time you haven't looked bored in the three months since you've been here is when we've been discussing this diagnosis.	7263
14	She has the right to know! It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.	7245
15	No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here.	7207
16	So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.	7189
17	Could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.	7186
18	Get your hands off me.	7180
19	Wanting to build a connection with your dad and pass on some of the joy that he gave you, that's not stupid at all.	7170
20	And you can tell Taub that he's gonna get the same treatment as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.	7091
21	And I need a transplant, and they say I don't have much time, so when I heard that you were willing, I just.	7087
22	So when I see symptoms magically show up right when you need them-- And I was your boss for seven years.	7071
23	Bob Harris, get on up here with that beautiful family of yours! Bob Harris, folks! Bob, your community activism, charity work, and character represent the finest Cedarville has to offer.	7040
24	If Foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes, coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.	7039
25	That's what I always said to you, Callie, but I had a problem-- I'm nothing like you! Tell them to do the surgery.	6994
26	And you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail-- That is actually not one of the many reasons that I don't own a gun.	6990
27	Your job is to be his friend, to stay here and sit with him and watch the fight on pay-per-view while bitching about me.	6979
28	Either your relationship just blows up like every other non-magical romance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.	6970
29	The only way that you don't worry about this hearing is if you don't think there's gonna be one.	6946
30	I'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.	6941
31	I'd call you idiots again, but at this point I'm starting to doubt whether you understand what I mean by the word.	6913
32	You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it because then with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor because I'd think I could control you.	6846
33	Now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation.	6810
34	Sometimes, the best way to connect with someone is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.	6769
35	All this time I've been blind to this waking life now I see it everywhere 'cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince yeah and I'm taking it one day at a time Hey.	6697
36	Foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard.	6690
37	They'll zip you up and dress you down and stand you in a row but you know you don't have to you can just say no Okay.	6690
38	Then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.	6683
39	Of course I do, but this is about your daughter too and I'm not gonna do something like this without your support.	6675
40	Your drinking wasn't funny then, and it's not funny now.	6658
41	If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding.	6586
42	And you're here in my heart Like when I gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.	6569
43	Okay, and I'm sure you're a nice person, but I just moved from Atlanta, and it's my first time at this gym, so definitely don't know who this Taub guy is, but I already agree.	6542
44	Your shoes-- a different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal.	6455
45	Can you dispute the possibility that, had you visited the patient sooner, maybe talked to the wife, been directed to one of the students, that this case might have ended very differently?	6437
46	I can't decide whether to take out an I told you so ad in the New England Journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.	6431
47	On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough to get diabetes even without him.	6380
48	I may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications, it might be a good time to come clean to your son, let his father visit.	6353
49	I gather from the silence that either you all agree with Chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.	6347
50	You don't think I knew House was gonna tell you to ignore me and not do the ultrasound?	6335
51	You told the mom something you want to believe because you don't want to believe that this girl might be doing fine parent-free.	6286
52	You have to tell the new doctors that he needs total body radiation and plasmapheresis.	6275
53	Like an idiot, I went out with my girlfriends to pretend I have a life, when all I did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom, miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.	6265
54	And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological-- Your parents didn't love you enough.	6261
55	My theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.	6251
56	We know there are some issues there, but your bone marrow could cure him.	6243
57	Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.	6236
58	If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.	6225
59	And although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.	6221
60	This is what you said you wanted, but you're actually more upset now that her husband knows.	6194
61	Now, I love you and all, my brother, but not as much as I love my gang of crazy, roided-out Nazi bitches.	6188
62	That the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching Martin Brodeur shut out the Rangers.	6187
63	Did you and the defendant spend the evening of October 8th watching the Devils game on TV, or did you just read about the game in the Chronicle while concocting this false alibi?	6186
64	It says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to China.	6174
65	There is a way that you can get your money back.	6161
66	And then what happened?	6154
67	You haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word loyalty, which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty.	6132
68	If you're motivated by caring, just bear in mind he's a dedicated chemistry teacher with a pretty wife and adoring students, baby on the way.	6124
69	Yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea, you know, with us working together.	6100
70	Because he sees insecurity, and when House senses weakness, he pounces, and because his insecurity is the fact that other people can have faith and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.	6099
71	All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them.	6095
72	Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy.	6089
73	Half the time you bring your cars into my garage, there's nothing wrong with them.	6084
74	The bet's that I'll get fired after my hearing! I'll take that action too, but you're already a C-note in the hole.	6083
75	The fact that she didn't burst into tears tells me that you never thought he was your dad.	6082
76	If I were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, I would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way and-- Sorry.	6072
77	I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees-- You know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.	6068
78	At least as good as the other 12 times that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.	6064
79	You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart.	6049
80	The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.	6043
81	Gotta build and destroy then rebuild and destroy oh, I'm gonna build, build, build destroy then rebuild and destroy Why am I watching you cut your hair?	6040
82	You know, I'm sure you're a nice person and you have no idea what you've gotten sucked into, but, really, I'm not interested.	6038
83	What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?	6012
84	Why do I need the pen that you always carry around and never write with?	6011
85	If you weren't wrestling with this, I'd say there's something really wrong with you.	5999
86	It's diffused into your skin, and the only way to get rid of it is to get new skin.	5997
87	I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong.	5984
88	Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact, same 45 minutes you weren't here.	5982
89	You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes ?	5976
90	What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.	5971
91	Working in prison, you learned criminals rarely target random strangers, and you've got more money than you know what to do with, so anything that seems different and fun's worth trying.	5960
92	Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter?	5954
93	I didn't put that there! You're gonna lie to my face, you lying son of a bitch! What?	5944
94	Is that your hand near her nether regions?	5938
95	You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's house and then fled the country for three months.	5937
96	Despite the fact that I know there's a gun in here, I'd never find it because you are more devious-- - Clever.	5935
97	And you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.	5933
98	You hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.	5921
99	which she'll prove when her parents show up and you start protecting her from them.	5915
100	'Cause if it's the same as yesterday you know I'm out just so you know because, because our paths, they cross Dad.	5910
101	I mean, do you think my father would have done that for ten minutes?	5902
102	You know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.	5902
103	And only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait.	5890
104	our paths, they cross mm-mm yesterday was hard on all of us on all of us == sync, corrected by If you don't know how to use a computer, we will teach you here.	5880
105	You chose me because you thought I'd have your back and I'd think twice about making a decision that would get you fired.	5879
106	Son of a bitch! Get away from them! House, House! It's a genetic condition! - Shut up! - Genetic! Your father has the gene.	5868
107	You're done here, just like every other place you've ever set foot in your life.	5864
108	Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting.	5856
109	What she does not need is you making this or any other decision.	5856
110	House actually presented the case in that way, or are you just trying to make him look bad?	5849
111	You knew the second you told me about this case that I'd get involved.	5848
112	And your thinking is that only you guys are qualified to sit in this room, doing nothing?	5845
113	In the middle of a procedure that could basically save your life, House is actually trying to drag people away?	5843
114	If all you do is physical therapy and your nighttime version of it, you'll lose your mind faster than you regain those fine motor skills.	5837
115	After you'd administered the Heparin, I see there was a discharge order on the chart, and yet the patient never left.	5826
116	Either you're getting her gifts because you want her to like you, in which case I don't like you, or you're getting her gifts to screw with her.	5821
117	If I ever see you in here again, I will write you up, and they will revoke your parole.	5820
118	No, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one.	5813
119	You pull the trigger, I drool a little fake blood, and then I spit out the bullet that the audience thinks I caught in my teeth.	5804
120	Start running DNA assays for sporotrichosis, meningococcemia, and any other boggle-winning words you can think of.	5803
121	But maybe some of the tripe you learn in anger management class might help keep this guy out of here the next time.	5781
122	You made nice-nice with Phil, you decided that he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.	5738
123	No! No! No! Get the cup! Get the cup! Just drink it! Drink it! No! Grab the cup! Hands behind your back.	5737
124	This is the only way you're gonna get your answer.	5729
125	Only so many hours you can cry and bang on the door before you give up, find something to read.	5724
126	Whatever the reason, it boils down to the fact that you may never walk again because House created an atmosphere that promotes recklessness.	5723
127	You don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife, not unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.	5712
128	This check is for significantly more than what I told you it would take to fund the department.	5711
129	Why don't you check his vaccination record before you make another stupid.	5710
130	'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.	5709
131	This kidney thing is the only evidence you have that he's sick.	5704
132	I'm starting to think, Mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.	5681
133	Though I can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, I want you to know that I have completed voluntary sexual harassment training.	5677
134	And there's your new team.	5665
135	You were saying something about how I should, like, uh, swab or-- You're confusing me with the clinic again.	5659
136	In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.	5658
137	I'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for China.	5653
138	There are hundreds of people who would do that for you.	5649
139	You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.	5626
140	You gotta push her neuroses to the point where even she thinks that she's crazy.	5616
141	You skipped over the actual DDX, and now you're averting your eyes.	5612
142	You were the Residency Director at Hopkins before you moved to Mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained Foreman.	5599
143	But if we can wake up and learn that the entire bank system has gone bankrupt overnight, it just seems stupid not to have a jack in the trunk.	5599
144	Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.	5592
145	What you're headed towards now, 14 hours a day in silent prayer, never having a family, never touching another human being.	5590
146	By your own admission, if you give the patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.	5589
147	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== as the new dean of medicine, I'd like to personally welcome all of our new employees and ask, why the hell do you want to come back?	5588
148	Praise for the singing praise for the morning praise for them springing Are you at least gonna call the cops this time?	5576
149	I'm gonna say it was the ex-girlfriend you cheated on, not the ex-wife you cheated with.	5565
150	Telecast, we expect an electric atmosphere in the arena and a sellout crowd of about 10,000 for Rubio versus Santos, two great fighters with illustrious careers who might have been expected to meet a long time ago.	5546
151	But then you'll get out, and unlike you.	5539
152	Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a patient into being tested is completely unethical.	5532
153	The artery that's bringing blood to your brain, it's coming apart.	5518
154	You're increasing the odds of that every second we waste here.	5515
155	The test is designed to determine if you're-- No, I mean your running a test and discharging me.	5515
156	Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you to let the guys know I'm not gonna be able to play on Saturday.	5509
157	A few years of therapy-- Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?	5506
158	Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them, and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.	5504
159	Because no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance, you didn't buy it either.	5504
160	But I know that all of you know him as the guy that owns the only gas station in town.	5499
161	There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip.	5495
162	If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.	5492
163	But House doesn't and I don't, so you can wait till he camps out on your parents' lawn or you can admit you don't live on some higher plane and thank me later.	5485
164	You were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.	5479
165	Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved.	5475
166	Interesting that you never showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer.	5467
167	If you think you're up to this job, it's time to lose them.	5466
168	I'm sure your mother's ready for a break by now, huh?	5463
169	But if you're having doubts about Chicago, I can call them back.	5456
170	Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr.	5455
171	Lie on the ground with your hands behind your head.	5440
172	Either way, it's more interesting than whatever you're doing now.	5439
173	Which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or because there is no new girl.	5437
174	I'm getting by by the way it's you on my mind Would you like to get a drink sometime after work?	5433
175	How about you have one of your peeps on the outside send $200 to my boy up in Trenton?	5432
176	You implied that all would have been fine otherwise.	5417
177	You're about to withdraw from the world for good.	5397
178	Oh, my God! We need help in here! - Go! - And they're off! You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?	5395
179	Getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board.	5387
180	Until your parents know, you will never see that punch for what it really was.	5386
181	Which is why you're not gonna live there either.	5369
182	If he thinks this is the only way to help your patient.	5358
183	You're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle.	5357
184	But let me be clear-- you mouth off to one guard, we catch you with a single cafeteria tray in your cell, you break any rules I don't even remember, you can park your ass here for four more months.	5356
185	So you just ran away, lived with friends, and partied with guys that you knew your parents would hate.	5353
186	I'd say I'm in the book, but not the one you'll be reading from now on.	5352
187	And I think that, if there's any chance I'm gonna walk again, it's because Dr.	5346
188	that and the fact that I was right about what's wrong with our patient.	5345
189	Because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.	5343
190	Simon Harris filmed the whole thing on his camera phone and posted it on YouTube.	5339
191	If it fails, then you will actually have proven that you can control me.	5322
192	You know, that can happen when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.	5318
193	Which is why you should accept his apology and come back on the team.	5317
194	You're gonna look pretty foolish if that was the wrong guess.	5315
195	Hands behind your head! On the ground! You are so lucky.	5307
196	Yet you were never anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison.	5297
197	I mean, you'll escalate, and then I'll retaliate, and the cycle will continue until we've both gone too far, at which point, I'll.	5294
198	You drove all the way out here just to tell us what you already told us.	5293
199	You're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds, and he was carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.	5284
200	Well, me and humanity, we got together too young.	5280
201	House has established that that's okay in his world, or his prank war distracted you, or House makes medicine a game, and you just wanted to beat him.	5278
202	Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah! [Foy Vance's Be the Song] And when you run This is Mark Sanchez.	5270
203	Just because that's what you'd miss the most.	5268
204	In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town-- ladling kittens, spaying soup.	5264
205	Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy, and I will give you your money.	5263
206	Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time.	5263
207	I'm smiling because, for the last 12 hours, I've been picturing you with orange hair.	5260
208	And then when you got tired of being a rebel, you just went home.	5258
209	And some of you may know him as the treasurer of our harvest scholarship fund.	5254
210	Followed your advice and took the night off.	5254
211	Can't take me down You know, there's a bunch of us going to happy hour after work.	5252
212	If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?	5244
213	There is something in this world you are undeniably great at.	5243
214	And that you were the reason.	5242
215	I know this is hard, and I'm sorry about your wife.	5238
216	But it must've been important that you stayed for both of them.	5237
217	The first thing you said to me was you don't want your old environment.	5219
218	The fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot.	5219
219	someone who's related to you, does that empirically make them more special?	5218
220	You can't go to their house without Foreman's permission.	5209
221	Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you.	5207
222	I heard about your conversation with the patient's daughter.	5205
223	I gave you time, Leeway, and you decided to do whatever the hell you wanted.	5202
224	She gave her notice the day after your incident.	5202
225	Which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.	5194
226	You just said you wanted to increase the steroids, and now you want to just-- - I changed my mind.	5176
227	Then you pumped his body full of Iodine and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.	5175
228	Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a szechuan beef.	5175
229	You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.	5174
230	He comes in with 11 straight knockout wins and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook was able to cut Rubio over the right eye in the tenth round of that last fight.	5170
231	I didn't even know you could do this! Start the blood thinners.	5159
232	Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! How do you keep doing the same thing over and over with the same level of enthusiasm?	5155
233	I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.	5146
234	Get the lecture out of your system so we can talk about my case.	5143
235	The plasmapheresis hasn't had time to work, but TTP is our most likely-- Okay, I'm just-- I have to go look for him.	5141
236	You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.	5138
237	How'd you get the firing wire into the Vicodin bottle without me noticing?	5135
238	Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee.	5134
239	It should open up the airways and buy you some time until the lungs are ready.	5132
240	There are 70,000 people in this country on the active waiting list for a kidney, and less than 10,000 dead people a year to give them one.	5128
241	We were talking about how you got the abrasions on your knees.	5124
242	Your friends, your girl, everyone you worked with, they've moved on.	5122
243	I thought I was here to treat the patients, not entertain you.	5121
244	If you'd have seen some of the kitchens or the processing plants I have, you'd cook all your own food too.	5120
245	I vouch for you to the cops, you take some parole-violating detour celebrating your freedom, justified, of course, by some absurd theory connecting it to donor.	5119
246	If you hadn't been screwing with me and put the idea in my head.	5119
247	I'd apologize again, but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.	5118
248	I consider these grounds to be a holy place, and I would ask you to observe them with due decorum.	5115
249	We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?	5113
250	If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist.	5110
251	The whole town knows that you're in the hospital.	5110
252	You see what the patient says about drug use when her mother's out of the room.	5110
253	If you believe me, then this issue will be resolved with no further action necessary.	5108
254	My father, but-- His place or yours?	5100
255	And I'm an idiot for thinking that your addictions were limited to pills, anti-social behavior, and sarcasm.	5095
256	It's not the place to exorcise your guilt.	5085
257	When that doesn't do it anymore, then you'll just.	5081
258	Two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.	5078
259	You know, I just got off the phone with some investors.	5074
260	You really like the idea, or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?	5059
261	I'll watch the baby again, and you can get a real night's sleep.	5054
262	I'm ju reading the notes on your desk.	5054
263	No, the part where he said that baby doesn't need you.	5052
264	They decided that your being stabbed.	5048
265	And, if you can honestly say that you don't like me, you don't have fun with me, I can accept that.	5039
266	Even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.	5038
267	If you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.	5034
268	You're the one who brought Andrews in.	5033
269	Because dangerous people don't break into your home, they live in it.	5032
270	While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.	5031
271	Don't worry, I know you're not the relationship type.	5027
272	And the subsequent lingering black mark on your record.	5026
273	It was just your misinterpretation of them.	5018
274	You can recognize that your patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom.	5017
275	Do you know any of the kids at the party with your son?	5014
276	You can't, and neither can I.	5010
277	You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from ever intervening, even if it's fully in the scope of my duties.	5010
278	I can't go back there! You may have a fungal infection.	5009
279	Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry-- I didn't do anything wrong.	5008
280	Sometimes, you just don't get the job, but.	5000
281	Because for some patients the diagnosis of anxiety disorder can actually increase anxiety, which is also why I told him he had a minor respiratory infection that was easily curable by the medication.	4999
282	I'll get the car and meet you out front.	4995
283	And you're definitely the type who'd want a gun.	4993
284	If your own kids are a scheduling item, maybe you should let one of them move.	4993
285	Before we proceed any further, Doctor, I'd like inquire as to exactly what procedure you intend to perform on the remains.	4989
286	I don't want to let House sabotage himself by sabotaging me, and I need your guidance and your trust to do that.	4987
287	Not only was there a gut tuck, nose tuck, and arse tuck, but her new, fake norks stick out like nuts on a mutt.	4986
288	You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there.	4981
289	You'd rather have House fire you than Foreman?	4976
290	So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was-- Sorry! Hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter.	4968
291	Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.	4968
292	I'm not the man you thought I was.	4968
293	You took the first deal they offered you, because you wanted to punish yourself.	4967
294	The transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.	4966
295	That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland.	4961
296	You knew that your patient was at risk for a psychotic break when you brought a scalpel within his reach.	4958
297	If he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the X-ray to do the autopsy.	4951
298	Just can't stand to think of all those patients going untreated because I don't have the resources to do my best work.	4948
299	Sorry to mess with your world view, but I'm not messed up, so my parents couldn't have messed me up.	4947
300	Why a man in your position, with your abilities, is incapable of shaking the impulse to act like an ass.	4946
301	Lying, neglecting responsibilities, and you can't stop, no matter how devastating the consequences.	4934
302	Are you saying that because you believe it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?	4927
303	And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?	4921
304	How do you know about my first kid-- Didn't even squeeze out a single tear at the funeral.	4921
305	Don't you think it's a little early to be dragging up our baggage in front of each other?	4919
306	You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt.	4913
307	Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister.	4909
308	If knew if you'd learned nothing else in here, you'd learned the smart thing is to fall in line.	4907
309	Looks like you might actually be telling the truth about something.	4907
310	If you don't mind paying a fortune in child support for some other guy's kids, no skin cells off my cheek.	4905
311	When your dad showed up unexpectedly, House have a hand in that?	4904
312	I got a call saying-- I'm here to find out why you didn't care about your first kid.	4902
313	You're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.	4901
314	I'm not lost I'm just looking for the prince and I'm taking it one step at a time and I'm getting by  	4899
315	You torched, nuked, and salted the earth with them.	4892
316	The patient had low opening pressure on his LP.	4882
317	Confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him and then completely forgot about it.	4880
318	! We have a little problem here! I need backup, I need backup! Alvarez! Mendelson! Sullivan! Mendelson! You're gonna pay for this.	4876
319	Your patients love you because you're empathetic.	4869
320	I know I'm not any good at being a clown yet, but when I do get a laugh and see those kids' eyes light up, that's how my dad made me feel when I was a kid.	4858
321	The legendary night on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.	4858
322	We know what you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work.	4851
323	Foreman, members of the committee, thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today, I.	4851
324	What about juice boxes in the break room for the children you'll be hiring?	4849
325	I'm sorry the first time I had both of you together I had to wk.	4849
326	It's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.	4847
327	Weathers, I am sure you're right, but we need to be thorough.	4846
328	And I'm not just saying that because you own a gun.	4838
329	And that's what you took away from this situation?	4838
330	If the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.	4837
331	The good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.	4832
332	You're trying to score points with him at the risk of a patient's life.	4828
333	I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.	4828
334	That fire, the bruise on your face.	4827
335	I didn't want you and the kids to worry.	4825
336	Whatever test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously.	4821
337	Your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.	4821
338	You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.	4819
339	So you don't date anyone unless I put the idea in your head.	4818
340	Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you.	4808
341	As long as you keep dealing with your doubts in the same way then.	4804
342	You probably wouldn't want to have sex with them.	4803
343	But when you think about the consequences-- Okay, let's go.	4800
344	He has Alzheimer's! It's freezing outside, and he's sick! I mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?	4795
345	You're the reason I'm out of the big house.	4793
346	You mentioned your car was in the shop.	4792
347	Which means I wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week by child locking all my cabinets, padding table corners, and getting rid of every single magazine.	4791
348	See, the beauty of the plan is that if it works, you think you can control me.	4785
349	But you know what the rules are.	4782
350	If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor.	4780
351	Your bigger problem is, the people who design those things aren't idiots.	4780
352	I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like every Friday, and I saw everyone else move into the living room.	4779
353	And neither should you.	4778
354	Then why are you doing this?	4777
355	I'm betting on them both being yours.	4771
356	You said that 9:00 was the premium slot.	4771
357	I'm betting on the last one.	4768
358	But he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.	4767
359	Nothing! You can't prove otherwise.	4767
360	Because you're not gonna be able to breathe.	4767
361	You think that's gonna last through the ages?	4764
362	No, it was just something I'd been thinking about and I figured, what the heck?	4762
363	Despite what the media would have us believe, you think we live in a very safe world.	4759
364	Many of our clients have struggled with addiction, and, if you want to get clean, we'll help you do that.	4757
365	You think you should kill yourself if you become a burden to the people who love you?	4757
366	I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I-- we're too busy for rationalizations.	4756
367	This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter y.	4753
368	Personally, I applaud your decision to step down off your cross and get on with your life, but your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.	4750
369	I need you to solve this, and I need you to do it without making me look like I can't control you.	4749
370	If it was an allergic reaction, the Corticosteroids and Epinephrine would have made him better, not worse.	4745
371	You think it's the end of the world, but you wanted kids.	4740
372	You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.	4739
373	You do know I punched the last person that pissed me off?	4738
374	House took your results after he manipulated you into providing them.	4736
375	Coworker whom you've known for almost ten years who nearly died and who's still scared he may not walk.	4732
376	If you had actually been in the room, questioning the patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.	4726
377	The fourth thing you said was, where's my old environment?	4725
378	You forced me to go with the options here.	4724
379	You don't remember your father.	4722
380	All you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.	4716
381	The good news is, made me realize that you were right.	4715
382	I know, which means you can't go either.	4714
383	You could probably just hide the porn in your underwear drawer.	4711
384	Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?	4708
385	You're not working for House anymore, which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.	4703
386	He's got a point, but I'll let you make the call.	4703
387	Probably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.	4702
388	In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?	4700
389	It's like you getting two women pregnant at the same time.	4699
390	Is there someone you want me to call?	4697
391	I assume you dosed the patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?	4696
392	Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you.	4695
393	But what did you learn about me that you hadn't known for years?	4693
394	Your patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?	4691
395	I think you're right about the strep.	4687
396	Aren't you supposed to figure out what you can sacrifice to maximize their niceness?	4683
397	The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up.	4680
398	He smacked his head against the wall.	4680
399	So you do realize that it is unacceptable to hit someone in the workplace?	4679
400	This is how you plan to get to the boxing game?	4678
401	I had Sophie again last night and Ruby slept in my guest room, which has nothing to do with Phil, who will never be a father to my children.	4675
402	I have no idea what flavor you are, so I decided to cover the spread.	4664
403	The food that you're eating to stop making you sick is making you sick.	4664
404	I think your symptoms are the result of alcohol abuse.	4662
405	Are you sure there's no one on the father's side of the family?	4660
406	Neither have you-- Analyze it however you like.	4659
407	You know what else doesn't show up in the blood work?	4658
408	Or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility.	4658
409	And old team for the win! Not that I'm keeping score.	4654
410	[Schuyler Fisk's Waking Life] There's an anchor that's pulling on my heart and it's deep in the water - Hey.	4650
411	I think you're a good person and a fine doctor, but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons.	4647
412	there ain't no one goin' to turn me 'round You're fired.	4641
413	They always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.	4639
414	Places where they send you You're trying to save me.	4638
415	Can you feel the sheets on your skin?	4631
416	Would you shut the blinds on your way out?	4631
417	You may not be aware of half the things you've done.	4629
418	I will choose to listen to your actions rather than your words.	4626
419	You know what happened here better than anyone, and you've worked with Dr.	4623
420	Why don't you show Joseph where the visitor's lounge is?	4617
421	The condition being that you're employed by me at PPTH.	4616
422	There are very serious risks, but if we don't figure out what he has, we can't treat him at all.	4615
423	You're gonna misplace one of them eventually.	4611
424	Just because you hung up your lab coat for more money and a bigger office?	4611
425	Getting House out of prison is the biggest decision you've made as Dean of Medicine, right?	4610
426	I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job?	4610
427	If you ever hear me mention anything about wanting kids, please feel free to punch me in the liver.	4610
428	You're not gonna close the wound first?	4610
429	And if I find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means I'm right.	4608
430	You know, the down vibe in here is totally ruining my Charlie's Angels fantasy.	4603
431	Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.	4603
432	Ben, you keep your grades up, you can do anything in the world.	4603
433	You know that close to 1% of the population identifies as asexual?	4602
434	You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with grammy Adams or cousin Itt.	4595
435	You open the door I want to be understanding.	4594
436	Foreman will find out you're taking this case, and he'll bust you.	4593
437	Is there some problem with the prescription you gave me?	4593
438	What the hell are you doing here?	4590
439	Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?	4589
440	What do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?	4586
441	If you'd like to talk to someone, we do have grief counselors at the hospital.	4584
442	Please accept this on behalf of all of us and know that we love you.	4583
443	You came to the hospital with beer in your pocket.	4579
444	They only come out when you're afraid or anxious.	4576
445	I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.	4575
446	You-- you understand them.	4575
447	If you're a match, but to increase our odds, we'd like to get your friends and faly tested as well.	4573
448	Yes, and-- and then you die.	4570
449	I'll let you know when we have the results.	4567
450	Keep your Nazi sentiments quiet around the little one.	4561
451	To give you the excitement you need so you don't go looking for it.	4559
452	Can you-- - I don't know how to use the program.	4557
453	You wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands.	4556
454	We can also provide clothes for the interview if you need them.	4551
455	Because of his heart problems, but-- Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.	4550
456	Just tell me your initial theory.	4545
457	You may remember me from the time I saved your life.	4541
458	I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the patient.	4541
459	Adams! They're gonna revoke your parole.	4539
460	If you're right, calcium channel blocker the lungs have no nervous system.	4537
461	You do understand the meaning of the word confirm.	4536
462	You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.	4533
463	Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.	4531
464	How many times have you thrown the truth in people's faces?	4527
465	You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here.	4525
466	You're one answer away from destroying their whole defense.	4525
467	Then we have to assume liver failure is just another symptom of whatever she's got.	4523
468	They hurt all your bits.	4523
469	You--you hope you're wrong for the sake of the patient?	4521
470	I actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes .	4519
471	So a few people are nice to you, and your first thought is, Hmm, this seems strange ?	4518
472	They just don't like you.	4516
473	His symptoms will go away and then I can show him he was never sick.	4509
474	She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago-- what about dengue fever?	4508
475	Could be your not-so-subtle way of implying this was House's fault.	4506
476	The advantage of fake prescriptions is, you don't have to be a real doctor to write one.	4506
477	And you said the Devils won?	4500
478	What are you planning to do now that you're not working for me?	4497
479	You think I'm not-- you think I'm not gonna go to Foreman with this?	4496
480	You don't think that will piss off your cellie even more when he figures it's a different bug?	4495
481	You're so happy with your life you've got nothing better to do at midnight than to come back into work to yell at me?	4494
482	You've only got her a couple days a week and most of that's spent with a rotating cast of nurses.	4493
483	Which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.	4491
484	When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?	4489
485	Because you realize they're not dull.	4483
486	You're either preparing to fight Pacquiao or you're having one heck of a bad day.	4483
487	If you want an accurate patient history, don't ever talk to the patient.	4481
488	So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat.	4480
489	And I'm sure your tests have come up negative, or you would have shut me up already.	4477
490	Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.	4477
491	So why don't you do the smart thing here?	4472
492	My husband saw you in the clinic.	4472
493	Oh, a sudden collapse at your age can indicate a deterioration of the heart muscle.	4462
494	And the nurses love you.	4461
495	I would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.	4457
496	I was hoping that your lack of emotion was a symptom of something you could have passed on to your first son.	4454
497	You could still pass the gene onto your children.	4448
498	And you can't know because you can't think clearly about her.	4444
499	You know, don't send out the marines.	4442
500	Brown Vestments means you're Carmelites, cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.	4440
501	Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.	4437
502	If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom never took him to a dermatologist?	4434
503	Have you sent the committee a character reference for me?	4433
504	Your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.	4431
505	But if you feel the need to manipulate me to make me feel useful, then yes.	4430
506	The only way that happens is you leave Princeton Plainsboro.	4428
507	We've got to get you back to the hospital right away.	4426
508	He's a minor, the mom's his guardian, and it's not even medically relevant.	4425
509	And I suspect that you've spent every minute since this has happened trying to answer that very question.	4420
510	I missed the fact that you were married.	4418
511	The guy who spilled a little DNA in her gene pool or the guy who's gonna be there day and night to pass on important values like not shtupping mommy after the divorce?	4416
512	These are your training wheels.	4415
513	Your Honor, may I submit the sports page from the New Jersey Chronicle on October 9th, 2011.	4415
514	Have you ever heard of the North American Man/Dead Boy Love Association?	4409
515	You find another angle.	4407
516	The fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.	4406
517	But if your get-House-out-of-jail-free experiment blows up in your face, it's not my job to get you out of it.	4405
518	Since an 18-year-old with organ donor on his license is not a cancer patient, I'm figuring the recipient is a lifetime member of the Wilson cares too much club.	4402
519	Sorry, but after Park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, I assume that plagiarism is the new black.	4400
520	As long as I don't hear it directly from her, then I can hang on to hope that it's not true.	4396
521	Well, you saw what happened in the yard with Diaz.	4388
522	This is fresh! You weren't at the dentist.	4385
523	You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?	4383
524	I will call off my pool, return the money, and we'll forget all about it.	4382
525	You're the one everyone dislikes.	4380
526	They missed your son's rash.	4379
527	But I don't think that's gonna change your opinion, because.	4375
528	Neither of you stepped out between periods, get beer, pick up a pizza?	4373
529	So you come back to the same building you've worked in for years.	4372
530	But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here.	4371
531	This is a real issue, and I have to worry about the big picture now.	4367
532	So now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.	4367
533	Your Honor, may I submit the Chronicle sports page from October 10th?	4364
534	He told me had a few glasses of wine, and that he shouldn't do it, but he also said that you were good.	4362
535	You can't take the money, House.	4361
536	Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson.	4361
537	Running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents.	4360
538	Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more humanely.	4358
539	Your son isn't wearing glasses in any of these pictures.	4357
540	Maybe you could tell your husband that we did.	4354
541	You add them all together, we get.	4354
542	Then I promise, I'll leave you alone forever.	4351
543	You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio fight?	4351
544	You clearly wrote that after the fact.	4347
545	The wife said she was sure to clear the house for her husband's safety.	4347
546	And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order.	4346
547	You must have broken into the wrong house.	4344
548	But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.	4340
549	You can't if you're not willing-- Just take care of yourself.	4337
550	'Cause your car is still in the shop.	4337
551	But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.	4328
552	I wouldn't be doing this if I thought there was another way.	4326
553	I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.	4322
554	The only evidence you have is proof of something else.	4322
555	Then why'd you lie about it?	4320
556	I know you're the better diagnostician.	4315
557	what do we got on this 18-year-old with the ear bleed and the breathing problems?	4312
558	I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you.	4312
559	You'll appreciate that I left the idiots subtextual.	4311
560	The fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her.	4304
561	To live, oh and I've been trying hard against unbelievable odds gets so hard in times like now to hold on but guns they wait to be stuck by Thirteen.	4298
562	I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning.	4296
563	The nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.	4295
564	There's the two of you kissing over dinner.	4292
565	Yes, but we won't know what until we access her alters and compare their symptoms.	4290
566	You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my patient.	4288
567	We think that's why you passed out and couldn't move.	4287
568	I was a mess, and she just sat there like.	4284
569	You weren't even there.	4282
570	You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?	4282
571	Turns out your blood was getting thick and syrupy.	4282
572	Otherwise, you are equally to blame.	4280
573	Did you get all the Vicodin you needed?	4278
574	This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the patient.	4276
575	House liked poking ant hills with a stick when he was a kid, and now he wants to do the same with us.	4275
576	They're gonna charge you with extra crimes.	4273
577	You two know each other?	4273
578	Why should you have to spend the night?	4270
579	Where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose.	4268
580	You just think they're fun.	4266
581	Are you real or just something from wanderlust who can you trust when tears we flower House.	4264
582	I told you, I was sitting at my desk when the attack happened.	4263
583	I didn't ask because you wouldn't believe the answer.	4263
584	Right, like group homes, where you're packed in with as many messed-up delinquent kids as possible, foster parents who only take you in because you're a meal ticket.	4260
585	But you found a tear just below the esophagus.	4259
586	Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.	4259
587	I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your house.	4259
588	I didn't do anything! Next time I will take your stereo! Ow! That was stupid.	4258
589	The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.	4257
590	The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass.	4256
591	Can you get me an escort to gather samples?	4255
592	Imagine what would happen if there was a terrorist attack on the food supply or a pandemic where we had to ration antibiotics.	4254
593	And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?	4253
594	But one of the only things that I can feel okay about is that I never hit her.	4249
595	Would you mind watching them for us?	4246
596	Could we go back on the record and get this over with?	4244
597	What were you doing when the pain came on?	4240
598	If Park is right, he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us, we can cross brain off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.	4238
599	fake an interest in them because you needed to, right?	4238
600	Your son Ben is in the hospital, at Princeton-Plainsboro.	4236
601	And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something.	4233
602	You already knew Andrews was drinking that night, didn't you?	4229
603	First 17 messages were cute, but-- I'm putting the band back together.	4228
604	Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey.	4227
605	which you might have, by the way.	4227
606	After 12 years, the active infection would have died down everywhere except the arteries in his brain, where it could hide out from our tests.	4227
607	I could add some Mercury, if you want to make it more authentic.	4225
608	If you don't believe me, call the monitoring company.	4219
609	I thought you'd rather see the company go under in New Jersey than thrive in China.	4218
610	There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.	4216
611	Your catheter bag is empty, despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.	4214
612	There really was nothing for him to do.	4213
613	want you to have them.	4212
614	And even if someone wanted to poison him, I don't see how they would do it.	4211
615	Actually there's two, but we don't have enough jell-o for the first.	4209
616	Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.	4208
617	Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	4207
618	We got the patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.	4204
619	I completely understand and almost respect your desire to appear to be Dean of Medicine, given that your title is Dean of Medicine.	4203
620	But just do whatever you have to do to get over this.	4203
621	Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.	4202
622	If you really love them back, then.	4200
623	Well, you lied about the boyfriend.	4200
624	Bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms.	4199
625	So what do you think-- is the patient paranoid or am I?	4198
626	Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fever, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription.	4198
627	I prepared the sarcophagus for you.	4195
628	I get that you're scared and guilty.	4193
629	It's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.	4190
630	House noticed hormone levels in your blood, and consulted me as an oncologist.	4190
631	I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.	4188
632	That actually makes sense, which I can't say about anything else you've been doing.	4186
633	You have them DNA tested yet?	4186
634	What the hell are you doing?	4185
635	Well, if you can think of a better way to prove that she's an idiot, I'm all ears.	4177
636	You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.	4165
637	This whole thing was about your ankle monitor.	4163
638	You're allowed to be at the hospital.	4163
639	They get to just hang out and do nothing?	4156
640	He was getting revenge for the orange hair and rigged it in House's office.	4153
641	I've ruled out Wegener's, Berger's, heavy metal poison-- two trains are about to collide, and I'm trying to talk them out of it.	4150
642	I thought Park and Adams were both right but that their conclusions were both wrong.	4150
643	So you're saying I got the clap?	4147
644	If you're speaking as a team member, then I'd say you're a moron.	4146
645	If you're speaking as Dean of Medicine, then I'd say you're a moron.	4145
646	Do you mind unbuttoning your shirt and lying down for me?	4145
647	You need help with the lacerations?	4142
648	You said the game wasn't typical.	4140
649	And if they find out it was me, I'm gonna lose my title and probably my job.	4140
650	I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really-- Oh, no, she could die.	4132
651	Can you believe she used to work in the can?	4132
652	Where did you unload the baby?	4132
653	I've thought about it, but I'd probably end up shooting someone in my own family, like when my brother tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.	4131
654	Now she can't--there's no reason for us not to call.	4128
655	The self-defense classes, you think they're making any kind of difference?	4125
656	Is there some black market in Insulin that I don't know about?	4121
657	They said you were almost killed three weeks ago.	4116
658	His fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about GAD and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.	4112
659	Park, maybe you'll like to update our esteemed colleague on the condition of our patient.	4112
660	With you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order.	4107
661	He yelled at you for letting me see the file?	4103
662	Short occlusion time of the artery, when the swelling goes down, you should.	4102
663	And I'd tell your former teammates to put her on steroids.	4101
664	I would just be you telling the truth.	4101
665	Morning! I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.	4100
666	You know, the least you could do is laugh at a dying lady's jokes.	4099
667	It's a little weird without the rash, but it fits all of his other symptoms.	4098
668	Y-you want to stop seeing each other?	4096
669	Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.	4096
670	And don't even pretend like you're not relieved.	4093
671	He broke out with a rash right after I tested with the wheat-allergy swab, but none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.	4090
672	I had the nails and eyebrows done, but that's it.	4086
673	So that must have been nice, having Ruby and the baby under one roof.	4085
674	Have you seen Bride of the Monster?	4082
675	We're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit and check back in two minutes.	4080
676	You could at least let her sleep in the room.	4080
677	You don't want to listen to me, then I don't want to listen to you.	4080
678	Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?	4077
679	Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night.	4073
680	You can look at the patient file if you want.	4070
681	Maybe not as much as this guy, but if people told nothing but the truth, the world would probably burn down overnight.	4070
682	And what about your idea?	4068
683	Did they tell you why?	4067
684	You're doing it to protect them.	4067
685	Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around.	4066
686	I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.	4065
687	I gotta make a hole so you can breathe.	4065
688	Or are you just trying to avoid talking about why you don't like working with me?	4063
689	You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.	4060
690	Not that much to the first, and not at all to the second.	4057
691	She is there for him in the only way that matters now.	4056
692	Add that to some peripheral red-green confusion, puts my money-- excuse me, your money-- soon to be my money on a tumor near his pituitary.	4052
693	If you don't let me read my email, then I won't be able to read the email to the entire staff.	4050
694	You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my patient is now in a coma.	4049
695	And now there's still something wrong with me.	4043
696	And that's just some of the lies from the last minute.	4042
697	There's a little mass here, and I'd like to get it checked out.	4042
698	Mom and dad were at each other's throats and the academic crisis was a cry for help.	4038
699	We'd like to perform an exercise test, re-create the stress that may have caused his symptoms.	4038
700	I can't justify buying video games and private schools when other people's children are starving.	4038
701	You got her the job interview.	4035
702	You wanna get back at these guys.	4034
703	I was giving you the gift of deniability.	4033
704	You have to have the treatment.	4033
705	Things don't seem small anymore, they-- I woke up from a nap and, uh, everything went from really small to really huge.	4031
706	I'd like to ask you about your grandson, Drew Lemaine.	4030
707	They'll lie, because if you knew.	4029
708	When's the last time you had a full night's sleep?	4027
709	He's your friend, and he's not well.	4027
710	What makes you-- Two lunch offers and a box of cupcakes since this morning.	4026
711	You're blaming the wrong guy.	4021
712	But that's not the idea House went with.	4020
713	You applied for the job.	4019
714	No, he heard the nurses talking about her, that she was short on time.	4018
715	The American Associate of Rheumatology wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday, in Atlantic City.	4008
716	House, you're in here because you think you can do whatever you want whenever you want.	4005
717	Well, if that were true, you'd be working right now and unavailable to help.	4000
718	I take it you're in the latter category.	4000
719	It stands to reason that your emotions factored in.	3998
720	It's not his spinal cord, it's the wiring between his heart and his brain.	3997
721	Next time, you could probably drop the undercover act.	3994
722	He makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience.	3989
723	Copying him makes you look pathetic.	3984
724	And you've always-- What's that from?	3983
725	Heart attack while he was on Interferon rules out encephalitis, but I still think I'm right about the neural symptoms.	3982
726	You have your own bathroom and office now.	3982
727	That's a pretty nice trophy, there, Andres.	3982
728	You're letting in the flies.	3978
729	Keep them stable as long as you can.	3977
730	You still never told me why you left the seminary.	3977
731	I assume you concur with the diagnosis.	3973
732	No offense, but, uh, I think it's terrible your dad's closing down all your American operations.	3964
733	Lets everyone know that you're not a teenage girl.	3964
734	You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.	3963
735	The Confederacy gave men $21 every six months-- - You poisoned us both.	3961
736	Are you now on the team?	3949
737	You're in the hospital.	3948
738	You worry about what people think of you, and parental secrets.	3947
739	Either way, we don't get his temperature above 95, it's not going to matter.	3947
740	As long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here.	3946
741	Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.	3946
742	Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.	3945
743	You show all the classic behaviors.	3942
744	I was just trying to protect him, like I should have done from the start.	3942
745	Oh, you think they're.	3941
746	You can't leave the hospital.	3940
747	Which is why I had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam.	3940
748	You're protecting the girl.	3936
749	There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?	3935
750	This is a big one, and it's the premium slot.	3933
751	By definition, no class can teach you to expect them.	3933
752	And there's no way I'm leaving him here unsupervised.	3932
753	No, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.	3932
754	You think he knows anything about women who don't want to have sex?	3929
755	Who the hell are you?	3928
756	Fresh from the word I need you to drive me to a doctor.	3927
757	You're in the medical profession?	3925
758	Kovalchuk had two, Arnott and Parise each had one, and Marty got the shutout.	3924
759	You're through the aorta.	3923
760	Code Grey! So your position is that your team's disobedience caused this?	3922
761	I thought you said that guy was one of your best doctors.	3920
762	The facts of this case, on the other hand-- the facts are in the file.	3920
763	You said you didn't anticipate their defiance.	3919
764	'Cause I'm not lost just looking for the prince I'm taking it one step at a time - Hey.	3918
765	Do we owe this case to your guilt at having ignored your own forgetful mommy?	3918
766	Then why're you telling me?	3917
767	So you want twice as many of them disrespected?	3916
768	I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes! Chase and Adams can do the test.	3913
769	No! Male patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?	3913
770	Might be easier if you'd stay out of the room.	3912
771	Then don't believe her, and start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.	3912
772	You do read the school paper, don't you?	3912
773	And you tested her-- see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.	3911
774	Didn't peg you as the midday fun kind of guy.	3910
775	You got the ending you wanted.	3908
776	Do you think getting beaten up, you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?	3907
777	That voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is not surprisingly wrong.	3907
778	Well, even if a neighbor saw us break in and called 911, unless they said we were armed, it's low priority.	3906
779	My mom says he was a loving father but always broke and always on the road.	3904
780	And you're not sure if he has brain damage from being frozen.	3897
781	And I was the one who questioned her, so, if there was an oversight, it was mine.	3895
782	She wasn't even gonna leave her until I said that I was letting you off early.	3893
783	It came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.	3893
784	And that's why men always marry their right hands.	3893
785	I'm going to assume this is another one.	3891
786	That's not what you wanted to tell her.	3889
787	Got you a Reuben from the cafeteria.	3888
788	This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.	3884
789	But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above.	3883
790	Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage.	3883
791	It's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.	3883
792	You hit, you make the call.	3883
793	My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.	3882
794	You ever see me chatting on the phone, taking visitors?	3881
795	The only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.	3880
796	Same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you.	3870
797	They've given you a great home.	3869
798	Hey, did you know your ex-wife still lives right behind this place?	3868
799	Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.	3865
800	How'd the mom seem to you?	3865
801	Just tell him about your parents or make up a lie.	3865
802	You obviously lied about sex and this.	3863
803	Surprised you didn't go into the diplomatic corps.	3860
804	ICU stands for take your time in Latin.	3860
805	I haven't even had enough time to eat my own lunch, much less run around trying to recruit nurses for yours.	3859
806	The one asking me to bring you some dinner.	3859
807	You want to believe the mythical biological connection excuses being a man slut.	3857
808	Which one of you is the cheap bastard?	3854
809	No, there's not even a bottle of wite-out in this place.	3853
810	House, the nurses saw you come in.	3849
811	You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument.	3849
812	You talk to her, the bet is void.	3848
813	I'll--I'll bet some of them bore you.	3845
814	And yet your first thought was frostbite?	3844
815	Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now.	3844
816	And, for the first time, she's acting like it.	3842
817	Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.	3837
818	But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't.	3837
819	You heard the calling?	3836
820	You were making it up to them.	3834
821	So you're zen about it but won't let go of your anger toward House?	3833
822	You say that like it's not gonna work.	3833
823	Starts with a surgical tool in your heart and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.	3832
824	And she was nagging you about finding a husband.	3831
825	Yeah, it's much more likely that I'm taking this case because I miss showering with Cro-Magnons than that I actually happen to find it interesting.	3827
826	If this is really about family, you will not do this.	3823
827	I'm an asset to this hospital, an asset you're about to lose to Chicago.	3822
828	Orgasms oxygenate the brain, lighting up over 30 different areas and making us forget how boring Susie Cooper is.	3819
829	If I had the power to veto him, given all the crap I've put up with over the years, don't know if I could use it objectively.	3819
830	You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement.	3815
831	You can cancel the hearing.	3811
832	A person experiences something that's too difficult to accept, so they create alternate personalities that don't have to accept it.	3810
833	So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?	3809
834	But you do know I just can't let this slide.	3804
835	And that probably leaves you as former Dean of Medicine.	3804
836	You remember the antibiotic they gave you?	3803
837	We get to stay here with the people who've been so loyal to this company.	3802
838	She can't share her problems with him, or plan for the future.	3798
839	The secretary said you were on leave.	3798
840	That's right, all those babies with aids, they're just using us.	3797
841	Are you sure Foreman's okay with this thing in his office?	3797
842	I'm not doing this for you.	3796
843	You think my judgment's the least bit compromised?	3795
844	Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat, do they contain bok choy?	3793
845	Does a friend watch you where it's happening, and wonder why?	3791
846	So who do you blame, Dr.	3790
847	So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?	3789
848	You can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.	3788
849	Also, you forgot to mention that your heart rate is slow.	3785
850	It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.	3784
851	I can't discuss any of that, not before the hearing.	3781
852	And check with admitting for the net worth of all new patients.	3778
853	You don't like that I'm reassessing my life, that I want to change it, that I can.	3776
854	Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest man.	3773
855	Meanwhile, he's keeping you here searching for a plan that doesn't even exist.	3771
856	Would you please read the caption under the photo?	3770
857	And I'm not one of them.	3769
858	How are things between you and your wife?	3769
859	We're in the hospital.	3768
860	The wife shut down a floral company to stay home and feed him every meal he's had in the last four years.	3767
861	But the steroids would have treated for that.	3758
862	Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?	3758
863	The point is, I gave it to you, so we're even.	3757
864	If it's a synthetic problem, more fluid will leak into h chest and his heart will fail.	3757
865	Y-you mean the treatment will, um.	3750
866	What, the wiliness with which Foreman ruled out anxiety or his complete wiliness-less-ness before he met me?	3749
867	'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you.	3749
868	And that was supposed to be the end of it.	3745
869	You had no right! This is none of your business! - I didn't.	3740
870	You turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?	3740
871	Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.	3739
872	A patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use, and obviously you're under hoe and office arrest.	3734
873	Your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.	3732
874	Couldn't stand to lose him as a patient, so you faked his symptom to prove you right.	3732
875	Wait until they take him back to his room--draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile.	3730
876	Swelling that fast and localized has to come from the lymph nodes.	3727
877	The new Dean of Medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks.	3722
878	And to wipe that out, you need special ops.	3721
879	You want me to return these?	3719
880	You missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors.	3717
881	I knew you'd move it somewhere outside your apartment until you were certain I'd given up looking.	3716
882	A second ago, you wanted to run like hell, and now you want to look for secret passages?	3716
883	Given that Martin Brodeur was scheduled to start but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.	3714
884	But when I was told the patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting.	3714
885	If there's even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.	3713
886	You've never done this before, have you?	3713
887	One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant, and we couldn't even get the kid a marrow match.	3712
888	I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.	3712
889	Our patient now has a mass in his neck, and his body temp's been rising over the last three hours.	3711
890	Wear them while you masturbate?	3710
891	You're hired! Oh, you guys are gonna love Doctors Chase and Taub.	3710
892	I know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.	3710
893	As for Santos, his handlers tell us that he's done more roadwork than at any time in his career, hoping to prove tonight that he can box for 12 full rounds.	3709
894	We were already stupid with the infection, but it's not too late.	3708
895	When you saw the boy.	3708
896	You break the law, you go back to jail.	3707
897	This might be the last time I ever know what he's thinking.	3707
898	I don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but I know she's right.	3706
899	You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old patients was denied.	3701
900	I admit I was stuck, until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his.	3699
901	And I don't want your help.	3699
902	You're not even doing this out of medical curiosity.	3695
903	I hope, one day, they'll understand that.	3695
904	My parents have a lot of money, but they didn't make it legally.	3695
905	Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere.	3693
906	When I left the room, he was telling her about the strippers from his bachelor party.	3691
907	If your name was Richard, it would be okay for me to call you a Dick.	3690
908	My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.	3687
909	It was wrong of me to confront you about taking Rachel to Portland.	3682
910	Plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you.	3681
911	The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.	3678
912	Here's your five grand.	3678
913	You have to believe that every parent screws up every child or you were screwed out of a decent childhood.	3676
914	No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him.	3675
915	Two hours ago, I found this in your closet in a box with your name on it.	3675
916	This is about you covering your own ass.	3673
917	And by money, you mean all your money.	3669
918	I don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response, but, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's on Black Friday, I wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.	3668
919	Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.	3668
920	And that haircut isn't helping, either.	3666
921	Maternal grandmother's worse than that.	3666
922	Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it.	3666
923	You the guy, the kidney donor?	3663
924	In either case, test for HIV and do an MRI to rule out tumors.	3662
925	All right, but I'm gonna have to clean you out.	3661
926	I'm glad you feel that way, because I do have a favor to ask.	3661
927	Great thing about assigning Taub fraudulent lab work is you know exactly where he's gonna end up.	3661
928	He keeps imagining symptoms, and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals.	3660
929	You don't have to work for House, but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.	3657
930	I mean, even if you are right about it, why take your word over mine?	3657
931	And you want to take that away?	3651
932	And I look forward to working with you as well.	3650
933	One day I was in the park talking with another nanny.	3649
934	Which helped me block your shot and will continue to help me defend myself in a building full of drugged-up strangers.	3649
935	And even if it did, they'd blame themselves for the rest of their lives too.	3647
936	You're bleeding through your bandage.	3643
937	And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.	3642
938	Go search his home, talk to his wife, see if you can get her to tell us what she used.	3641
939	No wonder you're playing handsies with her.	3641
940	Do you have any medical justification for your diagnosis?	3639
941	Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me.	3637
942	You screwed up the lungs.	3636
943	That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.	3635
944	And you never would have operated on her after.	3635
945	He's threatening to show your husband.	3629
946	Well, you don't have a gun, but you do have my sunglasses, my tennis racket-- I can't imagine why-- Had to kill a mouse.	3628
947	Think that's why they tested the V-22 Osprey there.	3627
948	You envied their dysfunction?	3627
949	There are Mees' lines on his fingernails, so now I'm thinking heavy metal poisoning.	3620
950	The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her, which started them on their journey to the esophagus and, ultimately, to the heart.	3615
951	Hope you practiced the immaculate contraception.	3615
952	Never said anything about the patient's husband.	3612
953	Or we'll go to the light box in the lab and know the truth once and for all.	3610
954	You're just agreeing with her because you think it'll create more conflict between us.	3609
955	Ow! I don't know why I'm starting to doubt your expertise.	3609
956	it fits all of his symptoms and exains why he got worse after the steroids.	3608
957	So why didn't you want to go with her this morning?	3604
958	But, well, if it was something in the water, it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?	3604
959	Apparently, you were right about that one.	3602
960	No, but digging delusions out of your skin with dirty fingernails could cause both.	3602
961	I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.	3601
962	And I know what a suspicious, micromanaging hard-ass you are.	3599
963	Flipd a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.	3598
964	you can get that without having sex?	3597
965	You really think I care about your car?	3596
966	Click the third tab from the left and find the box that says previous entries.	3596
967	And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.	3595
968	Then my dad got into narcotics, at first just selling but then using too, or he never would have gotten into the slave trade.	3591
969	Also, he started a betting pool on which kid is yours and which isn't.	3590
970	I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced Adams has parentally inflicted damage.	3588
971	I think that little of you and that much of me.	3587
972	There's plenty of time for that after the operation.	3587
973	Two of you go find her and find out what.	3583
974	I know about your deal with Adams.	3583
975	I--yes, I know I told you that I had a chiropractor's appointment, but, uh, I got a flat.	3583
976	You set the wheels in motion.	3579
977	With the Interferon his English should come back, and the aggression should subside.	3577
978	you already kn this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized.	3576
979	And why are you asking me about it?	3576
980	What would you think if you found out years later your beloved dead wife cheated on you?	3572
981	And now you're gonna tell me you didn't.	3571
982	If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron.	3570
983	If marriage is feeding and cleaning someone, limiting conversations, to repeating a few simple commands, then I was married to my pet rat.	3570
984	You dropped in the U.	3569
985	I guess that's why you wanted to work with prisoners.	3565
986	House can dance all over the rules, gets me knifed, and he gets a pass.	3565
987	'Cause I'm not sure the doctors over there would be so optimistic, considering.	3564
988	The Patuxent River Naval Air Station near D.C. was commissioned in 1943 by John McCain's grandfather.	3563
989	I want your stereo and your headphones.	3560
990	That last insult was your cue to leave.	3559
991	Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to probable.	3558
992	You really wanna turn your back on this guy?	3558
993	But some are physiological, and others are psychological.	3558
994	But when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.	3557
995	More than that, because you don't have an answer.	3554
996	Andrews is the one that should leave.	3552
997	I don't know the history, but everyone makes mistakes.	3551
998	You know, for someone who asks as many favors as you do, you sure don't make any effort to win me over.	3551
999	You haven't been that for two years.	3547
1000	You're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.	3547
1001	That was so I could ask about the second possibility.	3543
1002	It would have to be pretty far along because the first symptom was just a few days ago.	3542
1003	[Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On] Near, far wherever you are I believe This is so our song.	3540
1004	It's not looking good for Fahr's either.	3540
1005	And I want to let you know wanted to see how you were.	3537
1006	C.T. his liver, find the damaged area, and cut it out.	3534
1007	Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for.	3532
1008	There's no way that I'm letting.	3532
1009	And it's not in the pool.	3532
1010	You have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our patient presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.	3531
1011	Except for the annoying guilt about the husband.	3526
1012	There are a lot of good administrators out there, not many good doctors.	3526
1013	And when you do, I'm gonna take you to puerto escondido.	3524
1014	Yeah, how did-- I found out where your boyfriend lives.	3524
1015	Oh, my goodness, it is! Hi, Dean Foreman! Are you not gonna introduce us because we're married?	3520
1016	Aahh, she's dying! Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?	3519
1017	Better to have schtupped and lost then never to have schtupped at all.	3519
1018	Osler scarf-- only on Fridays, which means you did your residency at Hopkins, which means you're smarter than our interactions would so far indicate.	3516
1019	I would love for him to get out of here before the market opens.	3514
1020	His vision's back to normal, and if he remains asymptomatic through the night, we'll be able to release him in the morning.	3507
1021	Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.	3506
1022	This has nothing to do with the truth.	3505
1023	You're not gonna believe this.	3504
1024	Your hands are trembling.	3501
1025	When my mother drank, she couldn't handle me, so she locked me in my father's study.	3500
1026	and there ain't no one Bye, House.	3499
1027	Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.	3499
1028	And a little of, Who the hell is this guy?	3497
1029	Druggies are not known for their honesty.	3497
1030	You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.	3497
1031	Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone.	3496
1032	Before I ask any of you to sacrifice three months of your life for me, I have a confession.	3495
1033	I walk in in a suit, and they're gonna put their best foot forward.	3494
1034	You did not tell me you were involved in this case when you asked me to do this.	3493
1035	when you treat, and he gets better, and doesn't give Bob Cratchit Christmas day off, you owe me a coffee.	3491
1036	They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.	3489
1037	He's young, and he was perfectly healthy two days ago.	3488
1038	Your brain knew he's better off without it.	3485
1039	That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.	3485
1040	Tell all the alters that they have cancer.	3484
1041	Because nothing will ever change how I feel about you guys.	3481
1042	You have a problem with House, deal with it, or find someone else who can.	3479
1043	If you get him, what's that gonna prove?	3474
1044	Hey, keep your hands off my son.	3468
1045	Mitchell is not Ben's father any more than a sperm donor would have been.	3467
1046	The student aide was just trying to make a viral video, not hurt anyone.	3464
1047	This is the only way that I can do this.	3462
1048	With neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way.	3460
1049	There's a difference between an isolated riot and the fall of civilization.	3453
1050	Implicitly, you just said that Chase was at fault.	3452
1051	You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?	3451
1052	Oh, we kiss and cuddle, but neither one of us is interested in sex.	3450
1053	Does that mean you like your new life?	3446
1054	And those were your exact words?	3446
1055	What were you doing before this?	3445
1056	Hold the analysis and help me save this thing.	3443
1057	Why don't you go home and get some sleep?	3443
1058	Where are you getting this?	3442
1059	I now accept, that your all better.	3440
1060	I'm gonna need to see some stamps, uh, stereo-- just get 'em to me as soon as you can.	3440
1061	Still there's only one way to settle this.	3438
1062	There's nothing to talk about.	3435
1063	What about another clotting problem?	3432
1064	The risk is 1 in 4,000 I could die during surgery, which means, if I don't donate, I'm valuing my life at 4,000 times someone else's.	3432
1065	She's your road not taken.	3432
1066	Not outside the walls of this hospital.	3430
1067	Listen, I'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity.	3430
1068	All kids, not just yours.	3430
1069	Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the events of February 3, 2012 in patient room 209.	3429
1070	You're taking this case because we're running a phase-two trial on an Alzheimer's drug.	3428
1071	More than one, and you haven't.	3428
1072	His EKG, cardiac enzymes, and catheterization are all normal.	3427
1073	What if the scrapings from the bridge chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.	3426
1074	Have you considered sub-standard day care?	3425
1075	Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way.	3422
1076	And he was just the first.	3422
1077	You have one patient and three DNA results?	3420
1078	Blue Veil means you're a postulant, haven't taken your vows yet.	3419
1079	I don't care how sick your spouse gets, you don't jump ship.	3416
1080	What's with you and Park?	3412
1081	Park's tiger mom and dad were so insufferable, she has to measure their affection in hours.	3407
1082	You don't think I can keep this up all day?	3406
1083	In my opinion at the time, it was the rash that was gonna kill him.	3405
1084	It's clear you're back working for House.	3404
1085	He's saying he's sorry that someone, namely you, overreacted-- namely, by punching him.	3403
1086	Which means that Foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion.	3402
1087	That's because he is actually trying to get you fired.	3398
1088	If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call.	3397
1089	But not just there, um.	3397
1090	Patient didn't tell me the whole story, but he did say he'd be thrilled if we didn't cash this.	3395
1091	You heard about my parole, but not about my violent reactions when people steal my tuna.	3395
1092	You're not going to get any rest here.	3394
1093	Look what happened with London and the riots.	3393
1094	She obviously earned your respect, passed whatever test you-- I sabotaged her hearing.	3393
1095	So you're taking bribes to plunder graves, and I need to show respect.	3393
1096	I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you.	3392
1097	And you're sure he didn't leave until after 9:00?	3392
1098	All of the shift nurses had their hands full with a double code.	3391
1099	But I was hoping that you weren't capable of it.	3391
1100	You like your life that way it is.	3390
1101	I am an opportunistic ex-con who just gave you a two-minute sob story as step three in my master plan, and you've offered me $1 million.	3388
1102	Some nausea, dizziness, and as the tumor shrinks, there will be behavioral changes.	3387
1103	This thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood.	3386
1104	Telling the truth may have just killed this guy.	3386
1105	How did you find that without a stethoscope?	3385
1106	If you had been in that room, maybe that could have been you.	3384
1107	No, it's on the palms of his hands.	3384
1108	My advice to you-- figure out what line you aren't willing to cross for him.	3383
1109	Yeah, but you're hot, so it's easier to put up with.	3382
1110	He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans.	3381
1111	It sucks that there was a stabbing.	3380
1112	You two really need to do your homework with me.	3380
1113	But then these two believe that the policy of protecting American jobs starts at home.	3379
1114	Which means you didn't prove that I have a gun.	3379
1115	Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and fecal matter, both human and animal.	3378
1116	Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.	3377
1117	You're really not good at reading people, are you?	3377
1118	She's not your girl, you idiot.	3375
1119	When she opened the Magic 8 Ball, that triggered a switch to a personality with a strawberry allergy.	3371
1120	She'd been helping to make the altar breads that morning, but no hard physical work or repetitive motion.	3371
1121	You know, if you wanted, you could put an end to all this.	3370
1122	It means you don't have to make that drive.	3369
1123	You'll feel better, and she'll feel what.	3368
1124	If we had, the patient would have been anesthetized hours ago, thus unable to go all Chris Brown on her ass.	3364
1125	Your mom and stepdad love you.	3364
1126	At first, I thought it might be frostbite, but I haven't really been out in the cold.	3362
1127	That's why you cried out when House shot at Taub.	3362
1128	If we hadn't gotten past that, you wouldn't be here.	3360
1129	You're nothing without me.	3358
1130	I should just drive my car didn't it turn out that he'd stolen the hot dog cart?	3357
1131	It's not all about you.	3357
1132	There's no living relatives that I know of.	3357
1133	But you don't love all your patients?	3355
1134	If it was infection, there would be some sign of it in his blood or CNS.	3354
1135	The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation.	3354
1136	Why was it not already in the patient history?	3352
1137	Why didn't you tell me that before?	3351
1138	But you know that, which means.	3349
1139	Do you know what sound people make about him?	3349
1140	Sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.	3349
1141	She's not yours to fire.	3348
1142	A year on dopamine agonists, and he'll be a sex-crazed creep just like the rest of us, completely fascinated by Susie Cooper.	3347
1143	Something happened that you were upset about?	3347
1144	Pull! I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss.	3346
1145	It's been hard for him-- living in their house, driving down the same streets.	3336
1146	No one joins the clergy without having that epiphany.	3335
1147	Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says birthday clown.	3335
1148	And I will pay you not to go to anger management classes.	3335
1149	Are you thinking that maybe-- what?	3333
1150	How can there be that much tissue.	3332
1151	And you should update your resume.	3330
1152	Yah! What if he's right about the blockage but wrong about the cause?	3329
1153	But we have another option.	3328
1154	Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to achieve.	3328
1155	Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.	3327
1156	I knew that she was the woman I wanted to marry.	3327
1157	You think it's possible he knew what he was doing?	3326
1158	She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last ten years.	3326
1159	Can you tell me what this is called?	3324
1160	These personalities that I'm supposed to have.	3324
1161	I've tapped over 30 guys and never wanted to see most of them again.	3323
1162	But they need it more than people with TB or children in Indonesia with no eyes?	3323
1163	Or he's doing an amazing thing for another human being.	3322
1164	We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the patient to take off.	3321
1165	Your boss uses blackmail, and you question my professional ethics?	3320
1166	It sucks, but the Filipino factories suck worse, and the schools would suck if they existed.	3320
1167	There's definitely no poisons I could have accidentally been exposed to at home.	3319
1168	Your guilt is between you and your wife.	3319
1169	And you know him as well as I do.	3319
1170	Well, then, these giant balls of medicine are not gonna work anymore.	3319
1171	Chase and Taub are back! You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?	3319
1172	Your job description is doing what Foreman tells you to do.	3318
1173	Infected blood and tissue everywhere you look.	3317
1174	Not for your reasons.	3315
1175	Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my patient with renal failure.	3312
1176	If there's a little blood bubbling up, that's normal.	3312
1177	You know, if I need someone to watch her while I'm in class or, uh, on an interview.	3311
1178	It's got 106 leds, each one sending light to your eyes, slightly different wavelength.	3310
1179	Was that just so you'd enjoy saying no?	3309
1180	Are you trying to make this easy for me?	3308
1181	There was nothing owed.	3308
1182	I'm talking about your breasts.	3308
1183	You don't think I should have gone with rat?	3307
1184	Well, shouldn't you put yourself in that group?	3303
1185	I've informed Social Services of the mistake and given Jane Doe's description to the cops.	3303
1186	Took a team that was 0-6 all the way to the state finals at Long Branch.	3303
1187	Nice try, but I'm not getting in the middle.	3302
1188	And much as I'd love to hear you contradict me, I have a 7:30 appointment to explore my intimacy issues at La Scala.	3302
1189	He's also slept with her far fewer times than you have.	3300
1190	I've been trying to persuade the mother, but it's her son, so it's her call.	3297
1191	If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care.	3297
1192	You didn't choose me to oversee this because you thought I could be objective.	3297
1193	Maybe she likes the sound of my voice, which is weird because I have no genetic connection to her.	3297
1194	How do you work with a guy like that?	3296
1195	So you're just gonna let me walk out of here.	3296
1196	You're letting him get inside your head.	3295
1197	Understand your confusion.	3292
1198	They scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and I worked my ass off.	3292
1199	All right, we need you to sit back and try to relax.	3291
1200	Yes, and your sanity.	3291
1201	Probably because he just turned 40 and still goes by the name Tommy .	3290
1202	Who do you think was at fault for what happened to you, Dr.	3288
1203	And Chase brought a scalpel in there.	3287
1204	You think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life?	3287
1205	Try to find the patient some blood that's closer to his own.	3286
1206	You showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.	3284
1207	The Heparin decision didn't have anything to do with the outcome.	3283
1208	I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.	3282
1209	Before we get started, I just want to thank you all for agreeing to relocate.	3279
1210	And how did these orange smudges get on the patient files?	3276
1211	He doesn't test positive for that either.	3275
1212	, and you're gonna go back to jail.	3275
1213	After what happened to you, don't you wanna remake your life?	3275
1214	In which case, you cannot take his money.	3275
1215	You handle him and his wife.	3275
1216	And you'll never get her consent.	3273
1217	How the hell did I not see that?	3271
1218	And amusing myself at your expense.	3270
1219	I needed the cash, and, um, the locker was open.	3266
1220	And they don't dislike me.	3265
1221	It's just good to hear your voice.	3263
1222	Turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.	3263
1223	I know you don't want me here, but, um.	3263
1224	This was the fastest way to get it.	3262
1225	How can you be okay with this?	3261
1226	But you agree that empathy is a useful quality for doctors?	3261
1227	Ms. I gather from the silence that Chase isn't there.	3260
1228	Yes, please come back, and we'll get you started.	3258
1229	There are lots of doctors who can take care of him.	3258
1230	We don't even know if they were sleeping together.	3257
1231	Fresh plasma will replace the damaged red blood cells that are clogging his kidneys.	3253
1232	I only noticed because Chase was staring at them.	3253
1233	And your collective vomiting.	3251
1234	Are you trying to prove that I was distracted, that my judgment was compromised?	3251
1235	We've run every test and ruled out all the options.	3251
1236	There's definitely something wrong with him.	3250
1237	Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them.	3250
1238	People who are sick are not the only ones who need to be taken care of.	3249
1239	You thought it was insane, and yet you let it happen.	3248
1240	Why would you lie about that?	3246
1241	Gets another sleepover with da-da.	3245
1242	But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to.	3243
1243	And somehow, you managed to con her into hanging around.	3243
1244	And you weren't before?	3240
1245	Does your ex leave a spare key anywhere?	3240
1246	You couldn't wait to squeeze out a brand-new replacement kid.	3240
1247	What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis.	3239
1248	If your mom abused you, Social Services won't let you go home with her.	3239
1249	Then there's nothing we can do.	3237
1250	Yeah, and then he got her drunk.	3237
1251	you need to go prepare for your hearing.	3237
1252	Now that they're being filtered out, the blood would be.	3236
1253	More annoyingly, by having me do it and deal! Of course, you know.	3234
1254	There wasn't any money missing from the scholarship fund.	3233
1255	And I told you I wasn't listening.	3232
1256	So now you're preparing a Powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights.	3231
1257	I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.	3230
1258	Whatever age, living on the street makes her vulnerable to malnutrition, drug use, H.I.V. , all things which could explain her symptoms.	3229
1259	You're a bit late for that.	3228
1260	You could aim a lot higher than face paint and seltzer bottles.	3228
1261	Tell the Dean that I don't want to see her.	3226
1262	I'm assuming you're thinking something genetic, because-- I'm thinking addiction.	3224
1263	Our stock dropped a couple points today with the news that he's sick.	3223
1264	Eventually, you'll pass boredom and get to bonding.	3223
1265	Because it's the truth, not because we're gonna live happily ever after.	3223
1266	My father keeps up a good front, but he's just like Emory.	3223
1267	Well, that's what happens when you date a 12-year-old.	3222
1268	You have a spare tire in your car, right?	3219
1269	You give away millions and you don't own a suit?	3219
1270	What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you.	3218
1271	Which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.	3217
1272	If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time.	3217
1273	I could have you checked into a facility that exclusively treats mental disorders.	3216
1274	She went out of her way to defy me! She needs--damn it, you should just fire her! My apologies.	3216
1275	There wasn't any abnormal electrical activity in his E.	3215
1276	That's your follow-up?	3215
1277	Your daughter is better off without you.	3214
1278	Your parents know your call schedule?	3213
1279	So are you! She's found something she wants to build her life around.	3212
1280	And neither has the job, right?	3210
1281	Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot.	3210
1282	You do that on your own time.	3209
1283	About your disease, how it made you confess to crimes you hadn't committed.	3209
1284	Maybe she was opening a present that triggered the reaction.	3208
1285	I told my husband about you.	3206
1286	What exactly were you doing when you had your reaction?	3205
1287	Chicago has a great program, and you're a dumbass.	3205
1288	Joked about what a crappy deal you got for Manhattan?	3203
1289	You don't actually think this is neurological.	3201
1290	It's your choice to make House a useful tool or a monkey wrench.	3200
1291	There's someone I would like to call.	3200
1292	You don't even know what I just said.	3198
1293	You have any idea how that last CEO must have felt?	3197
1294	I just wanted to make sure you were cool if I go to without you.	3197
1295	The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.	3196
1296	Your job is to keep this machine running.	3193
1297	And then go back to sneaking around behind his back?	3193
1298	So you made daddy go away and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.	3190
1299	If we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the GAD, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection.	3189
1300	You really got a thing for swastikas, Mendelson.	3189
1301	You handle his house.	3188
1302	Think I'm gonna triple your clinic hours?	3188
1303	I'd like to try forcing an oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.	3187
1304	two sentences in, and you're already making promises.	3186
1305	I'm growing more and more curious by the moment.	3186
1306	Do you know what's wrong with her?	3185
1307	Yeah, the fact that we work well together.	3185
1308	Which could also be caused by choriocarcinoma, which affects the placenta, mimics pregnancy, and causes elevated BP and vaginal bleeding.	3184
1309	Means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.	3184
1310	Your parents screwed you up by not screwing you up.	3183
1311	And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.	3181
1312	I heard you're on that short time, House?	3181
1313	You didn't say that before.	3181
1314	This will calm your immune system.	3180
1315	Just thought you might need someone to talk to about it.	3180
1316	And then I could donate my other organs.	3180
1317	These guys have got that covered.	3178
1318	Get in line for meds! Asofa! Why you keep helping him out?	3178
1319	The gun slipped and-- I only had blanks in it, but.	3176
1320	Yeah, I was saying I agreed with the other one.	3174
1321	Yours eluded us 'cause it was caused by antibodies from your rheumatoid arthritis.	3168
1322	Why exactly is that good for you?	3167
1323	What exactly are they building back there?	3167
1324	Who is that, your roommate?	3166
1325	My parents had $800 between them when they got here.	3166
1326	Is another one hooking up with 38-year-old married men?	3166
1327	Think she's got the self-control to wait around for three years?	3165
1328	We can go through this together.	3164
1329	It was a long time ago, but still you're curious.	3164
1330	You don't know that you will.	3163
1331	He was the only boy that liked me.	3161
1332	You don't have to do that.	3161
1333	For every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.	3161
1334	When Vanessa was ready to quit chemo, Bobby's the one who got her to do one more round.	3161
1335	Pujols called and said the patient ran off.	3160
1336	Chesa, after giving the pics an eye or two, I can confirm that Lauren's surgeries cost her some big bikkies.	3160
1337	She couldn't handle the thought of being on meds.	3158
1338	You get a drop-down menu sorted by patient name and department.	3158
1339	This guy's the only one with symptoms.	3157
1340	Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.	3157
1341	Foreman warned us that you'd try something.	3156
1342	You have to go see him yourself.	3156
1343	You--you meddle and force me into impossible situations.	3154
1344	How soon will they know if it's cancer?	3154
1345	That new transmission I put in your truck.	3154
1346	I held the needle in front of the patient that set off his paranoia.	3153
1347	Yeah, why would I wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?	3150
1348	Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?	3150
1349	That soccer trophy you were telling me about.	3148
1350	Might not be a coincidence that the pain started on the verge of a major life change.	3147
1351	You need to get cotton swabs-- but not now.	3147
1352	I'm gonna call your P.	3147
1353	You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning.	3145
1354	Thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.	3144
1355	Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their elephant.	3143
1356	It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to judge the new one.	3142
1357	Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride.	3141
1358	To make him miserable or to forfeit your license?	3140
1359	What about over there?	3137
1360	You're gonna get away from him by turning into him?	3135
1361	Thanks for all your help.	3134
1362	Not taking your calls?	3133
1363	What did your parents do to you?	3133
1364	This is your new reality.	3132
1365	But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.	3131
1366	I spent half my time changing diapers and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.	3129
1367	You do have a classified ad and a piece of metal.	3129
1368	What did your screwed-up parents do to screw up your view of parenting?	3128
1369	As soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead man.	3128
1370	Not sure that's relevant to the equation.	3128
1371	I'm not the bad guy here.	3125
1372	Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks.	3125
1373	We swore that we would see the elephant together.	3124
1374	Actually, it's your mom's decision.	3124
1375	More clever and you'll always be one step ahead of me.	3121
1376	Counts for nothing if you can't defend it.	3120
1377	I just don't want to indulge your-- Lupus.	3119
1378	How about you drop it in your office?	3119
1379	Great thing about assigning Taub obviously fraudulent lab work is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.	3116
1380	Well, he was all, you know, I could take Stomper.	3116
1381	But there's always a chance we can't.	3116
1382	There's no way that Robin gave me an STD.	3116
1383	So we agreed that he would come in, but wouldn't touch the patient.	3116
1384	she lost the use of her arms and her innocence.	3115
1385	It's less dangerous than where you're headed.	3114
1386	Wait, why would you think his wife poisoned him?	3114
1387	Hey, maybe I don't have my father's crummy genes after all.	3113
1388	But if there's no boyfriend, where did the bruises come from?	3111
1389	We have to wheel this out to the MRI.	3110
1390	I get four, and I give you two.	3110
1391	We have convened the disciplinary committee to decide the appropriate action that should be taken against Dr.	3109
1392	That's why you're relieved.	3109
1393	If she likes crippled guys, I'm free for the next six minutes.	3109
1394	She said when her mom slips again, she didn't want to be there.	3109
1395	I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.	3108
1396	You know what that is?	3107
1397	House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a patient.	3106
1398	It's your first day back-- See?	3105
1399	Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up.	3104
1400	I give him the benefit of the doubt most of the time because I've seen what he can do.	3103
1401	Then he'll doze off, and then in a couple hours, he'll thank us again.	3102
1402	By breaking the rules, not caring what anyone else thinks.	3101
1403	Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier.	3101
1404	Another question is, could the paresthesia be caused by an STD?	3099
1405	When I was your age, I ran away.	3099
1406	House ordered a therapeutic bath first to wash off any residual chemicals from the blast.	3098
1407	Do you really want to do that to her?	3096
1408	She's not drinking the coffee either.	3096
1409	So your testimony is that Dr.	3096
1410	You can help with that?	3095
1411	I know what killed your son.	3095
1412	Because, because This is all you get.	3094
1413	You're not gonna put her on bypass?	3094
1414	He barely said a couple of words and set the boy off.	3091
1415	The way galaxies rotate, the motion of the Universe, it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect.	3090
1416	You're just setting yourself up to fail.	3086
1417	Just trying to understand you.	3085
1418	And the tox screen was clean.	3084
1419	You can go to hell! Why don't you kill yourself?	3084
1420	You don't want to move to Portland?	3083
1421	Most people give the minimum they have to give so they can enjoy what they have left.	3083
1422	'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives.	3082
1423	You're not allowed out.	3081
1424	I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.	3080
1425	Do you think I'm making this up?	3080
1426	Why didn't you just tell me what you were doing?	3080
1427	I thought you had a team for that.	3079
1428	And these ones were right.	3078
1429	His mother feels it's better to do the test at a different hospital.	3078
1430	You know that everyone on that panel hates you.	3077
1431	I'm not like you, House.	3076
1432	Do you have any questions before we get started?	3075
1433	I don't really care about the movie.	3073
1434	You can't let him do this.	3072
1435	He's on Heparin and stable for now, but this could put him at risk for stroke or embolism.	3072
1436	This is what you call going quickly?	3072
1437	There was a problem, but.	3071
1438	Now that happened either because Dr.	3071
1439	Weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated BP, causes it to expand and contract.	3067
1440	This is where you say thank you.	3067
1441	If only burnt lungs explained the passing out and paralysis.	3066
1442	You just saw him this morning.	3066
1443	The name she registered under seems to be fake, but the address is a foreclosed house.	3065
1444	We can't give you too much pain medication, or we'll make your condition worse.	3065
1445	Your heart said he needed to know.	3065
1446	Another dozen getting teargas hosed off them.	3064
1447	It's either gotta be his cell or his work station.	3064
1448	I can't think of another interpretation.	3060
1449	That doesn't mean you couldn't get angry.	3060
1450	I'll be doing what you would have done a year ago.	3060
1451	You're not sure of his name?	3059
1452	Doesn't quite make up for never visiting-- Springing you was Foreman's idea.	3059
1453	I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor.	3059
1454	You realize you're making House's argument for him.	3058
1455	You no longer have access to this patient.	3058
1456	But I need to see down your barrel.	3057
1457	That the heart does go on My patient is running out of time.	3057
1458	Could you help with that?	3057
1459	You went out of your way to help her.	3057
1460	All I care about right now is that my husband gets better.	3056
1461	You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?	3056
1462	Other than the fact that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships.	3055
1463	But it's a perfect time if you're a member of my team.	3055
1464	He has to base his decisions on what's best for the entire hospital.	3054
1465	Three weeks ago, you never would have slept with a patient.	3051
1466	Word is it was a celebratory slap after you completed your first-ever AVM embolization.	3050
1467	Out of the two donors who didn't walk out, both were negative for a potential match.	3050
1468	If my father had lived, everything would have been different.	3049
1469	You're going to Thailand.	3049
1470	She has to either dump him or forgive him.	3049
1471	I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr.	3048
1472	He really needs to know his dad just breezed in and out of his life, drunk and incoherent?	3048
1473	I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and manpower just to let this guy watch his mind shrivel and keep his wife miserable.	3047
1474	Foreman, would you please reach under your chair?	3046
1475	Does that mean you also have it?	3046
1476	The stress! And I get the runs almost every day.	3045
1477	House was like the child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang.	3045
1478	Adams, he endangered himself, and he endangered the patient.	3043
1479	You're not supposed to be here.	3043
1480	Although, to be fair, every man you've ever met has thought about having sex with you.	3042
1481	Then leave it up to me, and just leave.	3042
1482	The place'll be a madhouse, especially since it's two miles from the Rubio fight at the exact same time.	3041
1483	Please, you have to help me solve this thing.	3039
1484	That's why you left him?	3038
1485	Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances.	3038
1486	You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here.	3038
1487	House is here and apparently prepping for an operation that will probably kill a patient.	3037
1488	You're not gonna operate on her.	3037
1489	When I started giving away the money, I-- I hoped she'd want to do it with me.	3035
1490	It's amazing what people will tell you if you ask brutally enough.	3034
1491	Can you wiggle your fingers for me?	3034
1492	Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG.	3034
1493	Dr.Foreman said you'd try this.	3032
1494	[Fink's Yesterday Was Hard On All of Us] Where do we go from here and is it real or just It's working.	3031
1495	I'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.	3031
1496	I'll just tell you what I was-- Ah, ah, ah, ah! No spoilers.	3030
1497	You're abandoning me?	3028
1498	You're not helping Chase or our patient.	3027
1499	No, some guy almost caught me making out with his wife in their living room.	3025
1500	It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.	3025
1501	We all knew a psychotic episode was one of the three possible outcomes.	3025
1502	You think I did this to him?	3024
1503	Get out of here, House! Start the patient on plasmapheresis.	3024
1504	Maybe we should leave before the police get here.	3024
1505	Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.	3022
1506	And extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.	3022
1507	If anarchy breaks out, I plan to do what my ancestors have done throughout the ages--run.	3022
1508	Was there any money in it?	3021
1509	What did you think was gonna happen?	3021
1510	Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?	3021
1511	Think you're gonna have to pay off a bet?	3019
1512	it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right.	3019
1513	You could get more time with him.	3018
1514	When you say your boyfriend hit you, it means you actually hit yourself.	3018
1515	I thought for sure there'd be some yelling or profanity, possible bloodletting.	3018
1516	You have enlarged lymph nodes, so I'd like to start by ruling out breast cancer.	3017
1517	But anything you can remember might help save his life.	3017
1518	We should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.	3017
1519	I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.	3016
1520	Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right.	3015
1521	Did he meet your patient with renal failure?	3013
1522	Don't you guys think this is irresponsible?	3013
1523	I don't have time to teach you to act like one.	3012
1524	Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away.	3012
1525	That's why House used the hurt boyfriend story.	3012
1526	Since I have my kids for the next two days, I need a babysitter.	3012
1527	Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.	3012
1528	You're angry because your kid died.	3011
1529	You started college a semester late because you left high school a semester late because you had five incompletes in your junior year.	3011
1530	Then he's allergic to something not on the tests.	3011
1531	And you're a super-duper audience.	3011
1532	Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.	3011
1533	I know you don't think I'm an idiot.	3009
1534	It explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, everything.	3009
1535	In which case, I will be teaching you my secret homey handshake.	3008
1536	Or it's your family, some kind of immigrant pride thing.	3008
1537	What are you doing with her?	3008
1538	Do I need to pull out another card?	3006
1539	People donate shoes and suits all the time.	3006
1540	The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying.	3006
1541	Well, then what's this, then?	3006
1542	How could you keep this from me?	3004
1543	Not when we were together.	3004
1544	Or she ripped off the band-aid too late.	3003
1545	You're a moron and a coward.	3002
1546	How do you know your boyfriend's okay?	3001
1547	Are you sorry about what you did?	3000
1548	Did you use metaphors for your old team?	2999
1549	Wednesday, 2:43 p.m. , a black Pawn will believe he's the black King and attempt to capture the.	2998
1550	is the only thing that keeps me here.	2997
1551	You only have Park because she's on neurology's tab.	2997
1552	That was the whole point.	2997
1553	Now, if I punched him in the face, that he could prove.	2997
1554	Well, I'll try, but they spray so much pesticide I'm surprised we're alive.	2997
1555	The part where he said any parent who uses day care should ship their child across the country?	2996
1556	You sure you don't want to wait till after he answers your question?	2996
1557	So there's something wrong with her.	2996
1558	Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?	2996
1559	I wanted you to move on with your life.	2993
1560	Ever since then, he's been acting like he's actually trying to get me fired.	2992
1561	Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.	2989
1562	Wait, you understand him?	2989
1563	Are you going to have me fired for bad manners?	2988
1564	If the patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.	2988
1565	At least you two have that in common.	2988
1566	Foreman is transferring our guy to Princeton General as soon as there's a bed available.	2987
1567	They just don't usually broadcast all of them at the same time.	2986
1568	You never told me what caused your accident.	2986
1569	You don't write people up for mouthing off, do you?	2985
1570	You give away two kidneys, and you die.	2981
1571	How could the rest of us possibly understand?	2981
1572	According to Foreman, they're only for DDxing people who are still alive.	2981
1573	That explains everything but the lymph nodes.	2980
1574	Your mom knows she messed up.	2979
1575	Yes, and they want a controlling interest.	2979
1576	So I hear that La Crosse, Wisconsin has got the world's largest beer can.	2979
1577	There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.	2977
1578	I'm here for the free flu shot.	2976
1579	You're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.	2975
1580	25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got.	2975
1581	It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor.	2974
1582	It's the greatest mystery there is-- the theory of everything.	2974
1583	I'll clear it with your parole officer.	2974
1584	Have your boyfriend give me those samples.	2973
1585	At least 16, and I need them Friday at noon.	2973
1586	I also took $10,000 from the harvest scholarship fund, and I lost it gambling.	2972
1587	Your altruism was always a symptom.	2972
1588	Convent lets you have this?	2971
1589	But each time, it's just the best.	2971
1590	Yeah, it's the word might that bumps me.	2969
1591	What's somewhere he could see the kids arrive?	2969
1592	But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.	2968
1593	But how can you not be traumatized?	2968
1594	Did I mention they come and go?	2966
1595	And you said I wouldn't be able to help it.	2966
1596	There's nothing profound here.	2965
1597	He wandered out of the sandbox into the street, into the path of a moving car.	2965
1598	You have no idea how bad I feel about it.	2964
1599	No, I'm just saying what he's doing doesn't seem rational, which makes me think it's rational in a way I'm not privy to.	2964
1600	The neuro symptoms and the rash were both signs of an underlying disease.	2964
1601	There's only one way to find out.	2963
1602	That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives.	2963
1603	And get the real story on clown, senior's death.	2961
1604	So it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.	2961
1605	but we infer their existence because of the effect they have on the star they orbit.	2959
1606	We need to get him to the point he was at last night.	2958
1607	I realize this is probably a rhetorical question-- why are you stealing my stuff?	2956
1608	But that'll destroy the good lung too.	2956
1609	And they were, in fact, twins.	2955
1610	Too late for your eyesight.	2955
1611	It's just you have to go.	2954
1612	It's why I wanted to work with you.	2953
1613	As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.	2953
1614	What are you guys talking about?	2952
1615	At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily.	2951
1616	I took that scalpel for you.	2947
1617	Here's your new office.	2947
1618	His liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels.	2946
1619	Maybe I should just accept the patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.	2945
1620	That'd mean the damage was permanent.	2944
1621	I don't wanna give you money because you're an ass.	2944
1622	You're not getting enough oxygen.	2941
1623	It's your perfect patient.	2941
1624	Does there have to be some dramatic moment where the skies part?	2941
1625	If it's only in his epithelium, it wouldn't show up in his chest X-ray.	2940
1626	We need you to sit, focus, and answer our questions.	2939
1627	Chase is just looking in your throat.	2938
1628	I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.	2938
1629	This is just you haggling, right?	2937
1630	Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?	2937
1631	But Orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night.	2937
1632	Totally offsets the stench of suffereing and death.	2935
1633	Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician with political contacts, I'm busy.	2935
1634	The dining room's on the other side of that wall.	2934
1635	Well, the neighbors put in a pool, so he's been spending a lot of time over there.	2933
1636	I'll admit I was weak for a moment, but I'm not doing this.	2933
1637	Forget nun, you slept with a patient?	2931
1638	Priests and nuns were the closest I had to family.	2931
1639	You asked me to call and recommend you.	2929
1640	That's 'cause he's retooled the ol' todger.	2929
1641	If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.	2929
1642	I can't believe you did that.	2929
1643	So, at 6:00 a.m. , the patient wakes up, and the first thing he sees.	2929
1644	So your daughter was wrong.	2928
1645	You have to give him something he values more than honor.	2927
1646	If she dies, we'll be in the middle of a brand-new investigation.	2924
1647	Complexes of large, y-shaped antibodies were clogging up your blood vessels, causing your organs to shut down one by one.	2923
1648	The fact that he's dead makes it more interesting.	2923
1649	Don't get your hopes up.	2922
1650	If you're looking for someone to blame.	2921
1651	I didn't want the city to know about it.	2920
1652	Ugh! We hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.	2920
1653	Now that they know, they'll report me.	2918
1654	What's your patient's status?	2917
1655	Clever tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.	2917
1656	Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories.	2916
1657	Is this theory more promising than the others?	2914
1658	You're not giving it to me, are you?	2914
1659	That's why you wanted companionship.	2913
1660	So if I give you $200,000, I'll feel smart and pretty.	2912
1661	The aneurysm is just another symptom.	2911
1662	And mother is an abbreviation.	2910
1663	That's why you were late.	2910
1664	You need to check this out.	2909
1665	How do you know about ceftriaxone?	2908
1666	I told him because it was the right thing to do.	2906
1667	No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear.	2905
1668	Your small airways are collapsing.	2905
1669	You were cagey about where you were going.	2905
1670	'Cause that doctor didn't believe you?	2904
1671	Well, if you really want to thank me, my department's not really a department.	2902
1672	Did you just do that?	2902
1673	I'm a neurologist over at-- I know who you are.	2901
1674	It's not my problem if you go back to prison.	2901
1675	Maybe it's your character.	2900
1676	Could you just lower your voice?	2900
1677	I thought I was right about the rash.	2899
1678	It's the best thing for him.	2898
1679	It wasn't your fault.	2898
1680	There's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people.	2898
1681	His late father was a circus clown.	2898
1682	If it makes you feel better to think that.	2897
1683	How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?	2897
1684	Cold can be protective to the brain, but there is a possibility of damage.	2897
1685	No, if they're having sex, it's probably with their genitals.	2895
1686	Deleted all photos of you and Anita.	2894
1687	I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid.	2894
1688	It's not like I want to be cut open and have a part of me taken out.	2893
1689	I'm trying to survive on one a day for the next few days.	2893
1690	Glad to see taking a year off didn't dull your skill set.	2892
1691	And you won't be able to prove anything.	2892
1692	I'd want my husband to tell me the truth.	2892
1693	Your mom sends you to work with snacks.	2889
1694	Morning has broken like the first morning blackbird has spoken like the first bird praise for the singing praise for the morning praise for them springing fresh from the word 	2889
1695	They don't even really know me.	2888
1696	They had on on switch for reacting to smoke, but no off.	2887
1697	I assume, from the silence, that Chase has had a Brazilian.	2887
1698	let her be better off without you.	2887
1699	I just haven't found a way to make them interesting yet.	2886
1700	Why would you say any of that?	2886
1701	You should probably lie down and rest.	2884
1702	Forget about the bet.	2884
1703	Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.	2884
1704	He's even had defendants thank him after they were sentenced.	2882
1705	You slept with your patient?	2882
1706	Your mom didn't hit you, did she?	2882
1707	It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.	2881
1708	Just trying to help you out here.	2881
1709	the area moderating impulse control and compulsion.	2881
1710	Once you drink this, should get an attack almost immediately.	2880
1711	Said to tell you he's no longer your patient.	2879
1712	I have no idea what that second one stands for.	2877
1713	I like their oranges and lint.	2877
1714	I can understand the rationalization.	2877
1715	Why would you want to do that?	2877
1716	I can get you out of here.	2876
1717	He said, I've been working at this hospital for 15 years and I'm taking self-improvement classes.	2875
1718	He has a heart problem but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.	2875
1719	I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.	2874
1720	The daughter said that her mother died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	2874
1721	But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point.	2873
1722	I want to pay attention to them, but they're just so.	2870
1723	And you want to do some insider trading?	2868
1724	That's why we're taking the case?	2868
1725	This is why you get married.	2866
1726	Much as I'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole.	2864
1727	If signing off on everything House does is a pattern, it affects the way House behaves, it affects the way House's team reacts to the way House behaves.	2863
1728	Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.	2863
1729	Should be out of here within the week.	2861
1730	Hypothetical-- if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?	2861
1731	I just don't have the resources.	2857
1732	Is that how little you think of me?	2856
1733	Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?	2855
1734	Your colleague was stabbed.	2855
1735	I'm gonna have to dial back the nitro.	2854
1736	Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.	2854
1737	I might have cleared it with the cops.	2853
1738	You're protecting this girl.	2853
1739	I need to talk to you and Phil.	2852
1740	Prep the O.R. and get a gurney.	2852
1741	I can't make you do that.	2851
1742	We don't know if you're better yet.	2851
1743	She's smoking hot, and it's not his job to protect her marriage.	2851
1744	We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.	2850
1745	Dad, what are you doing here?	2849
1746	If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement.	2848
1747	What the hell does that mean?	2848
1748	Or I say thank you for not killing me.	2847
1749	You think one of Santa's reindeer was called Stomper?	2847
1750	Animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines when she went swimming.	2847
1751	Take him out of there.	2846
1752	You've had your hair cut three times since I've met you.	2845
1753	Other than the fact that my dad's in a coma.	2845
1754	I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.	2845
1755	Compromised immune system from living on the street could have made her susceptible to HPV.	2844
1756	The wife didn't know about the explosion.	2844
1757	But once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs.	2844
1758	Chips! You should have seen her face when mom walked in.	2841
1759	But you were actually a friend to me when I needed it.	2841
1760	There will be some discomfort.	2841
1761	Because you're paranoid about paranoia.	2840
1762	move the company and cost thousands of employees their jobs.	2839
1763	You're covering for him.	2839
1764	She traded up, married a lawyer, wants to forget the lowly circus clown.	2839
1765	Because you're not dying.	2836
1766	There's a canal near my mother's house.	2836
1767	I need to get away from House and everything that reminds me of him.	2835
1768	If not for cheating, I might still have a wife, but I wouldn't have Sophie and Sophia.	2834
1769	Now the sex is both commitment- and guilt-free.	2832
1770	It's better to think the man's dead but decent.	2831
1771	Put out an APB for a car with a man-shaped dent in the grill?	2831
1772	Those scars on my ass you may have noticed.	2830
1773	You shouldn't run from what can still be a good life.	2830
1774	If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove?	2829
1775	I'm gonna drop our kids off at my mother's.	2828
1776	Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you.	2828
1777	I was right about the antiemetics.	2827
1778	There's plenty of kids who hate their parents.	2827
1779	Do you really believe in this diagnosis?	2825
1780	We've got another five minutes.	2824
1781	If one of them's a match, that'd speed things up a lot.	2824
1782	What's your dentist's name?	2824
1783	Start the patient on statins, and do a biopsy to confirm.	2822
1784	Checked the anesthesia sheet, pressure was fine throughout.	2822
1785	'Cause I'm right here, you dick.	2821
1786	There's no need to put him under.	2821
1787	You didn't need to shoot yourself.	2821
1788	How about damage to her spinal cord blocking the signals from her genitals?	2820
1789	You have a LoJack on your leg.	2819
1790	Stop telling the nurses I'm looking for a girlfriend.	2819
1791	We'll start the steroids and see if it clears up.	2818
1792	How'd you even know to look for a tumor?	2818
1793	Uh, excuse me, miss, what is your name?	2817
1794	My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom.	2817
1795	What are you doing here?	2816
1796	I will see you this weekend when you pick up Sophie.	2816
1797	Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts.	2816
1798	You obviously don't care what I did.	2815
1799	And if you do it long enough, it becomes real?	2815
1800	He probably would have taken other kids to the playground.	2815
1801	I know you didn't feel anything when you almost died.	2815
1802	You're not infallible.	2814
1803	If it makes Andrews look sympathetic.	2814
1804	At this point, being he makes you feel better.	2814
1805	The affair with that girl.	2813
1806	I know he's talked about you.	2813
1807	Cuddy dark will waste his afternoon chasing conspiracy theories.	2813
1808	The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.	2813
1809	If you only heard claudication and carotid dissection.	2812
1810	She only had minor injuries, but her father died.	2811
1811	Because people never lie about people they hate.	2811
1812	I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room.	2810
1813	That's why I told you.	2810
1814	At that moment, he could only stay alive as long as my finger plugged the hole.	2809
1815	By definition, you have nothing to do.	2809
1816	Which is why Arceus created a universe with 3 states of matter and 300 solid or liquid poisons that could cause his symptoms.	2808
1817	Judge's order for your immediate release.	2808
1818	I usually have a student aide help me set it up, and apparently this year he added extra hydrofluoric acid, which is why it exploded.	2808
1819	Causes the symptoms to come and go.	2808
1820	You probably don't even think it's GAD.	2807
1821	I'll deny it, and he'll believe you.	2807
1822	Tularemia doesn't always show up in blood work either.	2807
1823	My life at home sucked, so I got the hell out of there.	2806
1824	I knew you could never do that to me.	2806
1825	More curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?	2806
1826	That's when you started to excel.	2806
1827	I was thinking just the two of us.	2805
1828	Playing the biology card doesn't change anything except where she lives.	2805
1829	My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.	2805
1830	We don't have the money to pay them.	2805
1831	But there is thickening in the lining of the wall of the third ventricle.	2804
1832	Didn't you marry someone you used to work with?	2804
1833	I'm really just keeping the seat warm.	2803
1834	I moved back home because it was too drafty at the four seasons.	2803
1835	Aren't you supposed to be pointing a finger at your own life as a cautionary tale?	2803
1836	Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.	2801
1837	But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.	2801
1838	What are you testing for?	2801
1839	Smile and say thank you.	2800
1840	Just enough to spoil your kids?	2799
1841	The job went away, but not the profession.	2799
1842	Why would she think you're a prostitute?	2799
1843	So I found a way to let you know to not be late.	2798
1844	How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the patient?	2798
1845	The donor spends a week in the hospita and up to three months convalescing at home.	2797
1846	There's no treatment for it.	2797
1847	What if you're allright?	2795
1848	You reassess your life when you've made mistakes.	2795
1849	Do you think that's crazy?	2794
1850	Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.	2794
1851	So I had to convince you that I'd given up looking.	2793
1852	You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first.	2792
1853	Well, when you put it that way.	2791
1854	You decided to move your company right after your wife died.	2791
1855	see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.	2791
1856	Because taking him off the antiemetics gave us crucial diagnostic information.	2788
1857	Outside this room, I pay you to parrot.	2787
1858	Why do you wanna give away your kidney?	2787
1859	You think that's pertinent?	2785
1860	So we figured the patient inhaled the extra large dose of hydrofluoric acid and.	2785
1861	You're incapable of human connection, so you want everyone to be like you.	2784
1862	What's your evil plan?	2784
1863	Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs.	2783
1864	The only thing I own worth protecting a thief would need a crane to get out of my apartment.	2783
1865	Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.	2783
1866	Your brain is exploding with oxytocin.	2783
1867	You don't have to feel so guilty anymore.	2782
1868	If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured.	2782
1869	You got my parole form in here.	2781
1870	From ashes to ashes from dust to dust I found your stuff in storage.	2781
1871	Eliminates most of her insecurity, she's immune to most advertising and can have honest relationships with men.	2780
1872	The police have been notified.	2780
1873	I did pay for the room for the whole week, but.	2779
1874	You really believe that.	2779
1875	It's the swab for wheat-based allergies.	2779
1876	Are you having trouble talking, like before?	2779
1877	Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?	2779
1878	Well, what about the patient?	2777
1879	I think I really dodged a bullet there.	2776
1880	What about House's theory?	2776
1881	Or is everyone afraid to say what they think the answer is?	2776
1882	I can barely look her in the eyes anymore.	2776
1883	To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression.	2775
1884	I'm sure it would mean a lot to him to see you.	2775
1885	Think you're up for answering a couple questions?	2775
1886	Negative for all our other exposures.	2775
1887	they actually have two completely different derivations.	2775
1888	We think you were having sex, but memory loss could also be a symptom.	2772
1889	Looks like you're gonna need a bigger rationalization.	2771
1890	Your life outside is over.	2771
1891	I break a rule, no one gets hurt, but you kick me off my own case?	2770
1892	We're warming his blood outside of his body, then putting it back.	2769
1893	I need to feel like he loves me more than other people.	2769
1894	I just haven't felt the calling yet.	2769
1895	Someone broke your heart.	2768
1896	No, that wouldn't chew up the bone that fast.	2766
1897	Because they don't know the real me.	2766
1898	If they found out what I've done, they'd be mortified.	2765
1899	A sign that you need to take a long vacation.	2764
1900	Then animal cases and ghost cases.	2764
1901	You had no right to say that.	2764
1902	While I was on the operating table, it didn't feel like a dream.	2762
1903	Especially since, with the extent of the emphysema, she needs a double lung.	2762
1904	You don't do that unless.	2761
1905	I don't wanna come back to work for you.	2760
1906	What happened to your eye?	2760
1907	Because you shouldn't be living on your own.	2758
1908	If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciprocate.	2758
1909	You're completely unhireable anywhere.	2758
1910	Which we won't know, because the E.R. put him on antiemetics.	2757
1911	He said-- no, I'm talking about the jell-o.	2757
1912	House on patient safety, Doctor, it is your duty to speak up.	2757
1913	What happened to your cheek?	2755
1914	Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.	2755
1915	You care that I lied to you.	2755
1916	Isn't that the point of having a spare?	2754
1917	Last month, I had an incident involving another P.P.T.H. employee.	2753
1918	That's why he'd lie to the guards.	2753
1919	Thank you so much for coming here.	2753
1920	I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.	2752
1921	Just bought yourself months in solitary.	2751
1922	I don't think he's moving the company out of greed.	2750
1923	Remember that guy from the restaurant yesterday?	2750
1924	Then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.	2749
1925	There's blood in his urine bag.	2749
1926	I'll leave you and Dr.	2749
1927	Ew! Your neck looks really gross.	2748
1928	Technically, you're back right now.	2747
1929	I take it felonies aren't a violation of your parole?	2747
1930	Which is a good thing, because neither GAD nor systemic infection would cause anaphylaxis or tracheal edema.	2747
1931	You're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney.	2746
1932	You do, and I'll prove it.	2744
1933	Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.	2743
1934	Fine, then give me a team I don't have to put in quotation marks.	2742
1935	Could the corticosteroids have somehow caused it?	2741
1936	Now that he has the power, he won't be able to resist the temptation to use it.	2741
1937	Because I'm just as bad as you.	2740
1938	I saw the boy who I was caring for.	2738
1939	Can you stay out of trouble for five days?	2738
1940	No! Your lips are swelling.	2735
1941	But like pouring water on a fire, that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash which made his immune system overcompensate.	2735
1942	So I decided, if I was gonna be the grown-up, I'd rather do it on my own terms.	2735
1943	Both your kids are named.	2734
1944	What's the hiring policy over there?	2733
1945	We just need to know if-- - No, I already told you.	2733
1946	How do you know she's happy?	2733
1947	There was no repartee.	2732
1948	Didn't answer your page last night.	2731
1949	I'm thinking-- you all right?	2731
1950	And then we ended up at the motel.	2730
1951	Getting along with her mother?	2730
1952	And now that she's a teenager, it's gotten worse.	2729
1953	Why did you ignore that risk?	2729
1954	'Cause your micromanaging kept us from doing a biopsy.	2728
1955	I'll give you your money.	2727
1956	Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?	2727
1957	How the hell did we miss that?	2726
1958	There are other ways to save the company.	2726
1959	I'm actually concerned it might be because of the change in management.	2725
1960	There's an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery of his brain.	2725
1961	We found more alcohol at your house.	2724
1962	No one else wants to talk about the patient?	2723
1963	Can you tell me your name?	2722
1964	I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral.	2721
1965	Then he's not allergic to it.	2721
1966	We were just looking for you.	2720
1967	What do I need to do for you?	2720
1968	I pay you to think inside this room.	2720
1969	I'm sure that's true if flag is a euphemism for penis and football is a euphemism for entering a vagina.	2720
1970	Oh, yes, they do! They're gonna find out eventually.	2718
1971	The world does that sometimes.	2718
1972	She's the same person who won't take my calls.	2717
1973	You just slept with her.	2717
1974	In 8 of 12 months time served we have the discretion to grant parole, Friday the 10th, five days from now.	2715
1975	How many times did the cock crow before Peter's third denial?	2714
1976	Lock up on your way out.	2713
1977	It can wait till you finish your work.	2713
1978	Well, how do you do that?	2711
1979	You should have told me you were treating an underage clinic patient.	2711
1980	Because the patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.	2707
1981	Were you taking Vicodin during this case?	2706
1982	But we went over the plans together.	2705
1983	All my friends' parents were divorced or having affairs or barely knew their kids' birthdays.	2705
1984	I wasn't exactly wrestling with great theological questions.	2704
1985	You've got your office.	2704
1986	I figure for sure he'd punch me in the face, thus proving it's a natural response.	2704
1987	Acute etoh ingestion could have-- hey, paint around them! Who's painting?	2703
1988	He was saying that things had been better lately between him and I, that I was happier.	2703
1989	You manufactured conflict with me so eventually you could let me win.	2702
1990	Because, because I'll meet you at your place at 8:00.	2702
1991	You need us to fix this little piggy?	2702
1992	I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.	2702
1993	My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes.	2701
1994	Your symptoms are real.	2701
1995	Guys, get your stuff.	2701
1996	Dr.Park, would you please reach under that chair?	2701
1997	You love all that caring crap.	2700
1998	Nice clothes and anger.	2699
1999	What kind did you have in mind?	2699
2000	Seems to have done you some good.	2699
2001	Do you have a cleaning lady who might bring her own supplies?	2699
2002	Don't forget the thumbscrews.	2698
2003	'Cause my boss says he doesn't have the money.	2698
2004	Nothing out of the ordinary at work or at home.	2698
2005	Enjoy what time you have left.	2698
2006	I've been ripping you all off for years.	2694
2007	The symptoms fit, and Andrews is a hack.	2694
2008	What I can't work with is someone who's here so she doesn't have to feel bad.	2693
2009	And by we, you mean you.	2693
2010	And by you, I mean me.	2693
2011	The patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher.	2693
2012	Iris! How do you know I'm lying?	2691
2013	To put it another way, a patriot.	2690
2014	The blast will fry what's left of his liver.	2690
2015	Why do you think I'm on buspirone?	2688
2016	You're not going to jail.	2688
2017	Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie.	2687
2018	Your car is getting fixed.	2687
2019	Just before you were.	2686
2020	It's not in the plans.	2686
2021	My friend is here because you didn't listen to me.	2686
2022	My problem is you thinking you're always one step ahead of me.	2685
2023	Yeah, like you losing your parole.	2685
2024	You never even tried to analyze this?	2684
2025	I'm not taking the risk.	2683
2026	There's just wet gum under here.	2683
2027	I'm not shooting you.	2682
2028	Would you look at this?	2682
2029	I couldn't tell you how many times she nearly O.	2681
2030	Everyone back at school is so worried about you.	2680
2031	Your arthritis is obviously-- I can pick up my own lawn.	2680
2032	At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?	2680
2033	The lung donor didn't have cancer.	2679
2034	Still mad about what happened in the lab?	2679
2035	It sounds like there could be spinal cord involvement.	2679
2036	Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan to shake your confidence.	2679
2037	Not for the Dean of Medicine.	2677
2038	Just came here to say thank you.	2676
2039	Did Taub put you up to this?	2675
2040	Actually, there's two.	2675
2041	Have I mentioned I don't trust the system?	2675
2042	What about the good stuff?	2675
2043	Because there isn't one.	2673
2044	It automatically slows the car when it senses I'm taking a curve too fast.	2671
2045	Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system.	2671
2046	I'm late for work in the clinic.	2670
2047	I just believe people are capable of more than you do, apparently.	2670
2048	Rhabdomyolysis fits the vomiting, pigmenturia, and renal failure.	2669
2049	There are two types of people.	2667
2050	No wonder you have such insight into my relationship with my babies.	2666
2051	I'm glad you're back.	2665
2052	But it ends, like, three feet further over.	2664
2053	And, most important, hence the anger.	2664
2054	By not screwing with you.	2663
2055	I know I have to pay attention to them.	2662
2056	How about we don't believe she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?	2661
2057	Why are you still here?	2660
2058	Your son worships him.	2659
2059	Is, uh, is this because of the medication?	2658
2060	We just need to get a good look at the rash.	2658
2061	Otherwise, we might not be able to find a marrow match.	2657
2062	Not here in the states.	2657
2063	One of them was a head CT, which uses.	2656
2064	What are you doing to him?	2655
2065	Your patient is two lungs in a box.	2655
2066	You claim you're not screwed up.	2653
2067	The usual safe ideas were not gonna work.	2653
2068	I'm not not the relationship type.	2653
2069	Well, it's not like I can get up and run away.	2653
2070	You're not a stranger.	2652
2071	Will you be instituting worker safety regulations in your new factories?	2651
2072	Can't you see she's upset?	2651
2073	Can you raise both your arms?	2651
2074	I knew this would fall on deaf ears, but I just kept talking and talking.	2651
2075	How does your ex-wife do it?	2651
2076	You really didn't know?	2651
2077	But, yes, you're right.	2651
2078	Move your cane, please.	2650
2079	The Heparin could cause the patient to bleed into his lungs even faster.	2649
2080	The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma.	2649
2081	There are those eyes again.	2649
2082	That's the correct answer, isn't it?	2649
2083	If she had any sense, she'd have stuck him in a facility and jumped on that strange-- Dr.	2648
2084	Together with the lung, it added up to Wegener's.	2648
2085	She robbed them of 12 years together.	2648
2086	I don't care if we might need them.	2648
2087	Is this from the alcohol treatment?	2647
2088	Maybe we could get a meal after work tonight, if you want some companionship.	2646
2089	Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.	2646
2090	Why don't you stay here toght?	2645
2091	I'm sorry, did you say something?	2645
2092	'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.	2645
2093	You need that medicine.	2644
2094	Knowing you can send me right back to jail?	2644
2095	Resume the antiemetics, and increase the sedation.	2644
2096	Could extend your life.	2644
2097	This is why we stopped the antiemetics.	2643
2098	Dean of Medicine from your old hospital.	2643
2099	you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you, didn't you?	2643
2100	Are there any side effects to the treatment?	2643
2101	Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings.	2643
2102	Andrews predicted the coma.	2643
2103	And the pericardial inflammation.	2642
2104	And she'll feel that way, right up until things get too tough and she has to start using again.	2642
2105	Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity.	2641
2106	So this is you trying to help me?	2640
2107	Which means you proved nothing.	2640
2108	I knew House wouldn't take the case unless I ruled out anxiety.	2639
2109	Because you work for House.	2639
2110	Now, that is authentic.	2638
2111	Come on! Thanks for getting me to the clinic.	2637
2112	I got it from the health fair I was working at.	2637
2113	For example, you're looking at monkey DNA.	2637
2114	Then we'll know what set it off.	2636
2115	He came up with the figure, not me.	2636
2116	Are your ears ringing?	2635
2117	Is that why you left?	2635
2118	Your hair smelled like Adams.	2633
2119	I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.	2633
2120	There's a hospital two miles from here.	2632
2121	I didn't say which side of the door he was on.	2632
2122	You can't be embarrassed about a manicure.	2631
2123	Even though there are three diagnoses?	2630
2124	Is that why you wanna be a nun?	2629
2125	I need to prove I have the confidence to disobey him.	2629
2126	You sexually molested your son.	2629
2127	Unless you want your own hearing.	2629
2128	Are you calling his liver fat?	2628
2129	So what's next for you?	2628
2130	You think it's cancer?	2627
2131	You can even have it back.	2627
2132	I just mean the part about the odds of it happening.	2626
2133	You need your own place.	2626
2134	You need to hang on to that.	2625
2135	And why did House think that was stupid?	2624
2136	By the time they get out of solitary, I'll be teaching physics at the University of Fiji.	2622
2137	Doesn't sound like the outside world got much of a try.	2622
2138	House, I worked for you for seven years.	2622
2139	Significant because Santos hasn't heard the final bell in more than six years.	2620
2140	You-- you don't scare her.	2619
2141	It was great knowing you.	2619
2142	What if I just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?	2619
2143	It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank.	2618
2144	We were together the whole time.	2618
2145	Aren't there actual medical tests?	2617
2146	They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry.	2616
2147	So are we gonna spend the rest of eternity in a lake of fire while pointy-tailed demons poke at us with sticks?	2616
2148	Now, how could I have gotten my hands on that?	2616
2149	I'm gonna get better at it, and it's not a hobby.	2616
2150	Maybe we should ask your wife.	2613
2151	We asked about toxins on the history.	2612
2152	Is there any way to take the edge off?	2612
2153	I'm defending the dad because he got screwed.	2612
2154	TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out.	2611
2155	House, what are you doing?	2611
2156	I want to build a connection with him, pass on some of the.	2611
2157	She's a homeless girl who's captain of the volleyball team.	2610
2158	But why don't you assume no recent meds?	2607
2159	He said you'd say that.	2607
2160	If we had more data on the exact type of melanoma his father had.	2606
2161	He just doesn't think being in the same room as the patient is crucial.	2606
2162	He's actually perfect for the drug trial.	2606
2163	Blackbird has spoken like the first bird What's wrong?	2605
2164	Your friend got stabbed.	2604
2165	Maybe we find you a new hobby, one you're a little better at.	2604
2166	'Cause he'll be dead if he doesn't get one in the next few hours.	2604
2167	Were you high on that trip?	2603
2168	And mom's determination to keep dad away, even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.	2603
2169	Those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital 100 bucks every minute I keep them waiting.	2601
2170	Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.	2601
2171	You need to keep up your rep.	2601
2172	I hear one of you thinks I'm a real bastard.	2601
2173	Are you sure you don't want to start over?	2600
2174	Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others.	2600
2175	Patient had V-tach in the echo lab, so we capped him, but.	2600
2176	You can't just take off.	2599
2177	Are you gonna test my urine or what?	2599
2178	There's some sweats in the closet in the back.	2599
2179	And everyone else just went along with this?	2598
2180	Because they don't cost anything.	2598
2181	My first job out of law school was at the health department.	2598
2182	How else do I compare them to other genetic disorders?	2597
2183	How much damage could you have?	2597
2184	We need you to help us with something.	2596
2185	There's gotta be a deeper reason.	2594
2186	You can leave when I have an answer.	2594
2187	You're trying to screw with my confidence.	2594
2188	Oh! There is one more thing.	2593
2189	Do you like your dentist?	2593
2190	It's the neurochemical basis for bonding.	2591
2191	You've got nothing on me.	2591
2192	I need to examine your son.	2590
2193	Could it be she doesn't know the difference?	2588
2194	You're thinking lung cancer.	2588
2195	Uh, it'll just be a couple of minutes till someone's ready to see you.	2586
2196	She'd rather remember her like she is now.	2586
2197	Jane Doe is flourishing without them.	2585
2198	Got something for you.	2585
2199	There are other options besides living on the streets.	2584
2200	There's a magnet on the fridge they use to open child-proofed cabinets.	2584
2201	What was the point of the orange hair?	2584
2202	Showing weakness is what gets you killed.	2584
2203	Do you know what sound he makes?	2583
2204	You know what sound he makes?	2583
2205	Your stock price will be completely cured.	2582
2206	Either way, I'm covered.	2581
2207	To do that, I need to know what he's doing and planning.	2580
2208	Don't tell me you have.	2579
2209	So, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.	2579
2210	So you need to prove your superiority.	2579
2211	You know, I'm a little tired.	2579
2212	You sure you wanna do this?	2577
2213	What about the psychotic break?	2577
2214	Well, that very evolved of you.	2576
2215	Good to see you on your feet.	2576
2216	But we haven't reached the stomach yet.	2575
2217	Why would you think you needed so many guns?	2575
2218	Where's that petition House's P.O. sent over about getting his ankle monitor off?	2574
2219	Dead kid's house was on the way to my apartment.	2573
2220	In other words, loyalty gave him cancer.	2573
2221	The first one was regarding Chase.	2573
2222	So many children of your own.	2572
2223	did you think I was referring to sex?	2571
2224	Your heart's beating too fast.	2571
2225	I'm the one who did the test.	2570
2226	I love them more than anything, I just.	2570
2227	If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up.	2569
2228	Says the doctors here can no longer be objective since the stabbing.	2567
2229	I know when House went to prison, you quit medicine.	2566
2230	Have you gotten any strange letters or packages recently?	2566
2231	What about the JBE virus?	2564
2232	We'll let you know what we find.	2564
2233	It's the most famous conjoined twins in history.	2564
2234	'Round-the-clock or not, parenting's an impossible job.	2563
2235	He can't keep them at his place.	2563
2236	Whereas you just dabble in crazy.	2563
2237	Did your son ever smoke marijuana?	2560
2238	Your patient's stable?	2560
2239	Don't let House get to you.	2559
2240	Well, if you change your mind, we'll be at Rudy's.	2559
2241	Just hiding out till House leaves the cafeteria.	2558
2242	It can make you very, very late for very important dates.	2558
2243	Then I decided I should test his wallet.	2558
2244	You really haven't changed.	2556
2245	Why would they thank him?	2556
2246	If you need help, you can take whoever you want.	2555
2247	He's just taken up performing and it's very stressful for him.	2554
2248	If you don't mind me asking, why are you becoming a nun?	2553
2249	You take very good care of him.	2553
2250	Oh, just how different the two cultures are.	2553
2251	I love my husband, and I would not ever even for a second consider doing anything to hurt him.	2552
2252	Early may is when the surf really picks up but.	2552
2253	Then it's a good thing he has A.	2551
2254	About the other night.	2551
2255	You're gonna get us killed.	2550
2256	Also, Chris Christie's blog says the pancakes here are the best.	2550
2257	The way her eyes looked when she smiled.	2549
2258	Or something is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree.	2548
2259	Look, the point is I saw this coming.	2547
2260	Who cares how they found it, okay?	2546
2261	Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida?	2545
2262	You know I'm a doctor.	2545
2263	Wh-what if I don't want the treatment?	2545
2264	Your daughter has ascariasis.	2545
2265	And Dr.House is sure that's what she has?	2544
2266	You don't have a fever.	2544
2267	Which will be bad news for both of you.	2543
2268	You of all people should know better.	2542
2269	I'll take the fallout from Social Services.	2542
2270	Do you feel any tightness in your chest?	2541
2271	Your daughter has a Berry aneurysm.	2540
2272	Reveal yourself! Now.	2540
2273	Number three went to a baseball game the day before he donated.	2538
2274	But it's definitely on the wish list.	2536
2275	Because the patient was unconscious.	2535
2276	You were right about Nicole.	2535
2277	I would have donated the money to charity.	2535
2278	You clamp now, she could stroke out.	2535
2279	All right, I'll take the other ticket.	2535
2280	Believe me, I'd rather be the guy with the clipboard.	2534
2281	The bathroom's that way.	2533
2282	You can't afford a team.	2533
2283	To a guy who loves penis enough for the both of them.	2532
2284	The Berry aneurysm must have just burst.	2532
2285	I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was.	2531
2286	You didn't have any priors.	2530
2287	What if the chicken was the egg?	2530
2288	I know you disagree with-- Dad.	2529
2289	That God's love is speaking to you directly.	2528
2290	Squamous cell middle ear tumor could have caused the ear bleed.	2525
2291	Do you mind stepping out for a moment?	2525
2292	Not seeing an embryo in the fallopian tube.	2525
2293	You don't have to sign it.	2524
2294	I didn't want you to think you needed medication.	2524
2295	I'm gonna call the ambulance! No.	2524
2296	We'll see if the Board agrees when I tell them the whole story at my hearing I already did.	2524
2297	It's helpful for society if its members have positive feelings about that society.	2523
2298	I hope it works out for you.	2523
2299	You said we were meeting for coffee.	2521
2300	Do you think I'm right?	2521
2301	Devils' starting goalie for, like, the past 20 years.	2520
2302	I don't want to validate his ridiculous theory.	2520
2303	I'm wrong all the time.	2519
2304	You're screwing with me.	2519
2305	Then I have to tell them first.	2519
2306	A couple nights a week with each kid may make you feel better.	2518
2307	If we add clotting disorder to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.	2518
2308	The body slows down when it cools, but it doesn't fully stop.	2517
2309	Which also happens to be what the mom wants to believe.	2517
2310	If it's a disease, then he's six inches under.	2516
2311	es ==SPREAD THE WORD== So how does a completely healthy teenager have a mini-stroke?	2516
2312	Don't we need to get you to a doctor?	2515
2313	I'll be deciding your fate today.	2515
2314	You're a lot taller than I thought you'd be.	2515
2315	It could if you also have paraneoplastic syndrome.	2515
2316	Must be such a pleasure to live in your head.	2513
2317	We booked the O.R. for an hour from now.	2513
2318	But you already promised it to someone else.	2511
2319	Two lives are in the balance here.	2511
2320	You go to that fight, you go to prison.	2510
2321	You do a tilt table test, see how his heart rate responds.	2509
2322	We only really started talking again because of the reenactments.	2509
2323	Why are you looking at her?	2509
2324	You also wouldn't have to be at work.	2507
2325	The echo will show us any growths on his heart valve.	2507
2326	Are you saying I'm crazy?	2504
2327	We can't actually see them.	2504
2328	And that's from a guy with one alimony and two child support payments.	2504
2329	At least tell me you haven't been drinking today.	2504
2330	If you want my money, I'll need to see a five-year plan.	2503
2331	I don't blame either one.	2503
2332	What are you gonna do?	2502
2333	Following your heart is easy.	2502
2334	Ah, explains the hole in this chair.	2501
2335	It's not even clear if our patient just had a heart attack or what it was.	2501
2336	Let them spend five minutes together.	2501
2337	You admire this girl.	2500
2338	You didn't have a bad lawyer.	2499
2339	We really gotta get you laid.	2499
2340	So this is the family's best hope.	2499
2341	All parents think their kids are special.	2499
2342	Now is not the time, Bobby.	2498
2343	More likely the patient has a hyperammonemic problem.	2498
2344	God, but you're petty.	2496
2345	I claim this burger in the name of Queen Isabella of Spain.	2496
2346	She was the girlfriend of a loser drug dealer.	2496
2347	You will be eloquent in your loss.	2496
2348	House's part, don't you think?	2496
2349	Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Social Services report came in on your mom.	2495
2350	Yeah, how many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?	2494
2351	Hey, wha-- is that the infection?	2494
2352	I'll be here as much as you need.	2493
2353	Oh, yeah, your-- grabbed your tushy.	2492
2354	Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.	2492
2355	You called Social Services for real.	2492
2356	I've never been hit in the eye before.	2492
2357	In fact, he actually called you Stompee, with an ee.	2492
2358	Pull down your pants.	2491
2359	Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.	2491
2360	Could be wrong about the symptom.	2491
2361	What else would explain our symptoms and make our patient go into a coma during that test?	2491
2362	Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.	2491
2363	They look just like me.	2490
2364	He'd never admit it, because he doesn't want to offend you.	2490
2365	Hey! I thought you weren't getting back till tomorrow.	2488
2366	I was gonna make you bring me a bottle.	2488
2367	You're scared, aren't you?	2487
2368	Which brings us back to, why do you care?	2487
2369	I wouldn't have been in the room.	2487
2370	Off at his other clinics.	2485
2371	Goin' to turn me around there ain't no one goin' to turn me around ain't no one.	2485
2372	I was trying to use the phone.	2485
2373	He could do a lot of damage in there.	2484
2374	She's tired of living on the streets after all.	2484
2375	She got sick in the middle of her 14th birthday party.	2483
2376	You've been in a coma for several hours.	2483
2377	You don't own anything you need.	2483
2378	Your heart rate is speeding up.	2483
2379	14-year-old, your freedom, our asses?	2483
2380	Looks like you're ready to go home.	2482
2381	Which is good news for you.	2481
2382	But I've got two, and this woman has none.	2481
2383	Heard your arm's healing nicely.	2478
2384	Martin Brodeur stops 1 of his 36 saves on the way to a shutout victory.	2478
2385	He's not in the hospital.	2478
2386	Screwed up is your best case.	2476
2387	You were wrong about encephalitis.	2476
2388	We he him on the donor list for a liver.	2476
2389	You don't wanna mess with Stomper.	2475
2390	Which you're gonna use to do an ultrasound-guided biopsy.	2475
2391	House is not the problem.	2475
2392	was the only neurologist I could reach.	2474
2393	Can you tell me what happened to me?	2474
2394	I don't want to be lied to, and I can't live like that.	2473
2395	Now, many of you may recognize him as coach Bob of our champion little league team.	2471
2396	You're crushing me! Wake up! I think you're having a heart attack.	2471
2397	you double your clinic hours.	2470
2398	Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment?	2470
2399	I could have given you a Section 8.	2469
2400	There's always chemo.	2469
2401	They never drop character while in uniform.	2468
2402	Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom were so indifferent, he has to believe it's a wash.	2467
2403	Dr.Blackenshmurtz will accuse me of writing about the punch after the fact.	2467
2404	The lungs will never be viable for transplant.	2467
2405	Have you ever watched one of those?	2467
2406	Could have moved on to the real thing.	2467
2407	Cut yourself shaving?	2466
2408	What happened to the social worker I called?	2466
2409	Actually you have to.	2465
2410	Wait, I thought-- I thought you said it was stable.	2465
2411	Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back.	2465
2412	Excuse me, Your Honor, may I approach?	2465
2413	You're a prisoner on tier time.	2464
2414	How about I help you out?	2464
2415	They need something to break the tension every once in a while.	2463
2416	I can get the words out.	2463
2417	It seems like Graves disease or some other thyroid issue.	2462
2418	You're clearly getting squeezed.	2462
2419	If you move it, it'll be without me.	2462
2420	'Cause if he admits he was in a fight, then he goes to the hole.	2461
2421	I think you're having a heart attack.	2461
2422	You said you weren't gonna overrule me diagnostically.	2460
2423	Unlike you, I don't need drama.	2458
2424	It could have been me on the floor.	2457
2425	Where are the DNA results?	2457
2426	You refuse to bet on yourself.	2457
2427	Following your brain is tough.	2457
2428	I'm sorry I led House to you.	2457
2429	They're not starving.	2455
2430	Oh, it feels like you stuck me with a hot poker.	2455
2431	You were expecting to bore us for at least half an hour.	2453
2432	So they thought the patient would be better by now.	2452
2433	Find out what's causing the meningitis.	2452
2434	Taped under your chair is an index card.	2451
2435	You felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.	2450
2436	Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.	2450
2437	Did you just eat something?	2449
2438	Appreciate your help.	2448
2439	You love your family.	2448
2440	The jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.	2447
2441	Would you--would you tell me what's going on?	2447
2442	You're lying, aren't you?	2447
2443	She was next up in the clinic.	2447
2444	Which apparently really bugs you.	2446
2445	You just need to answer a few more questions.	2446
2446	Whipple's explains all of his symptoms, including the personality change.	2445
2447	Well, I'd take me if either of us could.	2445
2448	He just got them a couple of weeks ago.	2444
2449	You're out tonight on conditional parole.	2444
2450	I need to DDx a patient with you.	2444
2451	Which means you're both idiots.	2444
2452	Chase said you had something to tell me.	2444
2453	The joy that he gave me.	2443
2454	The word transient is right there in the name.	2442
2455	But you'll get over it.	2442
2456	Everybody has to pay for their sins.	2441
2457	You couldn't just ask me to stop being late?	2440
2458	They were good parents.	2439
2459	You think she fell out of bed, repeatedly?	2438
2460	What exactly are you scared of?	2438
2461	Told me to call him if you did.	2438
2462	On the plus side, I can now program my DVR from my phone.	2438
2463	So as much as my better nature really wants to give you a pass.	2437
2464	I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.	2435
2465	You'll be here six more months, minimum! Sorry.	2434
2466	Because he doesn't treat them like scum.	2434
2467	I haven't left the hospital in four days.	2434
2468	Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.	2434
2469	Why do you care if he works on two cases?	2433
2470	His parents died young.	2433
2471	You have one lying around?	2433
2472	I haven't heard the name Bobby in a long time.	2431
2473	Are you asking me if I think my wife is trying to kill me?	2429
2474	We would have seen evidence of brugada in the E.K.G.	2429
2475	It just appeared in the last few weeks.	2428
2476	Yes, I figured it was from the radiation.	2427
2477	I--the bet is-- - But I thought-- - After-- - then-- - I--oh-- if only.	2426
2478	What happens when the stunt doesn't work?	2425
2479	I told the drunk, racist frat guy the proper term is conjoined twin, not Siamese.	2424
2480	Well, I'm gonna go through the laundry.	2423
2481	The bulge wasn't caused by pus or blood.	2423
2482	If you like tuna, you're a little late.	2423
2483	Your occipital lobe is acting up, giving you a migraine.	2422
2484	Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr.	2421
2485	You told me i was going to be okay.	2421
2486	Except there's no blood.	2421
2487	Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.	2420
2488	Then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.	2420
2489	He's done everything you've asked.	2419
2490	Or you're terrified of intimacy, which is why you're a serial slut.	2418
2491	But you don't buy it.	2418
2492	you cheated on your taxes?	2417
2493	Would have seen it on the MRI.	2415
2494	You're getting weaker.	2415
2495	The guy was going downhill fast.	2414
2496	He said the work's been paid for.	2413
2497	I brought it to your cell.	2413
2498	I think they got the cause of death wrong.	2413
2499	If our donor had an allergy, it could explain the lungs.	2413
2500	He can't say my kids until he lets me test them.	2413
2501	Watching them, not making them.	2412
2502	You're apparently asymptomatic.	2412
2503	I'll drive over there.	2410
2504	We share a traveling X-ray machine two other clinics.	2410
2505	Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.	2410
2506	Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.	2409
2507	But these things take time.	2409
2508	But I've never seen you use rosary beads.	2407
2509	On all of us Thank God you called him.	2407
2510	The problem was the patient's brain.	2407
2511	Embrace your inner bitch.	2407
2512	Callie agrees with you.	2406
2513	You're welcome, House.	2406
2514	You still have an hour left.	2406
2515	You need to leave him alone.	2406
2516	Especially since you're short a team member.	2405
2517	I spent the night with her.	2405
2518	My brother, the General here, gots the green-apple quickstep.	2405
2519	After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.	2405
2520	Patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate, real estate that's been conquered 800 times by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures.	2405
2521	There's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest X-ray.	2405
2522	Because you had lousy parents.	2405
2523	I wanted to spend my life with you.	2405
2524	The closest I got was Waimea Bay.	2405
2525	But he never had the power to overrule me.	2404
2526	He wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.	2404
2527	You brazenly defied your boss.	2404
2528	Your judgment's compromised.	2404
2529	It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.	2403
2530	Just when they're beginning to, uh.	2403
2531	And I lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead child.	2403
2532	We're going to the hospital for tests.	2402
2533	You knew on Monday, you get out Friday.	2401
2534	She's the only woman to ever do the catch a bullet trick.	2401
2535	Surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance.	2400
2536	Let's just hope no one cut the wrong wire, eh?	2400
2537	Are you telling me you didn't care?	2400
2538	Are you gonna punish callousness?	2400
2539	Why don't you take preventative?	2398
2540	I'll give $1 million as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.	2398
2541	You have four days left.	2397
2542	You think I'm hitting on a nun?	2395
2543	Now, if you'll excuse me, I ha to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.	2394
2544	You're allowed to go home.	2393
2545	If you were me, what would you do?	2392
2546	You told me it was okay to leave.	2392
2547	We've gotta stop seeing each other.	2391
2548	I object to your cynicism.	2391
2549	You are a good man who made a mistake.	2390
2550	You're trying to make me look stupid.	2390
2551	It's even crazier than the gift thing.	2389
2552	I've known my husband longer with his Alzheimer's than without.	2389
2553	Eventually, you will screw something up.	2389
2554	It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.	2389
2555	Hey! Sit down! Where's the aspirin?	2389
2556	You said I was wrong.	2388
2557	The antibiotics we gave him actually started destroying the syphilis.	2388
2558	'Cause even though you don't find my case interesting, you find my interest in it interesting.	2387
2559	His kidneys died, they transfused.	2386
2560	You feeling any pain or cramping here?	2386
2561	There's a mass in the arm.	2386
2562	Have you been having regular periods, Iris?	2385
2563	Wilson my ass! I told you to leave him alone, you son of a bitch! Temper trigger.	2384
2564	There's no joint pain.	2384
2565	What did the endoscopy show?	2384
2566	Could you write me a fake prescription for Insulin?	2383
2567	He'd want to get out of the wind.	2383
2568	Occult choriocarcinoma, which is why we didn't see it on the ultrasound.	2382
2569	You have a dead patient?	2381
2570	there's no sign of tropheryma DNA.	2379
2571	Why are you doing time?	2379
2572	We thought the case was over.	2379
2573	Or something you wear, own, use, or gave him.	2377
2574	You're up against a lifetime of training.	2377
2575	Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to locate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair.	2376
2576	House is screwing with you.	2376
2577	You can't take sex from a sexaholic.	2375
2578	We're treating you for an overactive thyroid.	2375
2579	Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?	2375
2580	It's more of a grid where I assign numerical values to determine who gets raises, vacation time, and my respect.	2374
2581	There's subtle eyebrow loss.	2374
2582	Called you his China doll?	2373
2583	Allergies, paresthesia, vision loss, changes in blood pressure.	2373
2584	You think his sexuality is normal?	2373
2585	There's a neurological issue.	2372
2586	There's no breath sounds.	2372
2587	So for the past few months I've been.	2372
2588	What are you planning to do?	2371
2589	Flout my authority, make the hospital look bad, back to jail.	2371
2590	There's no actual risk.	2371
2591	He may just be shooting himself in the ankle.	2371
2592	Do you hurt anywhere else?	2370
2593	If you want silence, you can get ear plugs.	2369
2594	Because you're an idiot.	2368
2595	Ben, you barely knew him.	2367
2596	I thought you don't like favors.	2367
2597	Will you please just go away?	2366
2598	I need to justify buying them.	2365
2599	You have a brain tumor, okay?	2363
2600	I should have told you.	2363
2601	The girl I was seeing wasn't.	2362
2602	Took a job-- Don't need the details.	2362
2603	There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.	2361
2604	I don't want to needle the carotid.	2361
2605	You think he's allergic to Iodine?	2360
2606	Take her off the Ceftriaxone.	2359
2607	Gentle is the sun It's been years.	2359
2608	House finally got you.	2358
2609	The stink bomb was Chase's.	2358
2610	no, his biological father.	2356
2611	Did you have surgery recently?	2356
2612	Oscar, I gotta call you back.	2356
2613	I was in prison, you see.	2356
2614	I feel like you don't respect me.	2356
2615	How do you expect to get into a good college?	2355
2616	You feel guilty about leaving.	2355
2617	You don't get it, do you?	2353
2618	I was at my lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.	2351
2619	There's no calcification.	2351
2620	I was being authentic.	2351
2621	You didn't just burn bridges.	2351
2622	Have never cheated on you.	2350
2623	I think you should give House permission to go to Atlantic City.	2349
2624	Repeat this, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.	2349
2625	I want to be with them.	2349
2626	Stress wouldn't be relevant, but anything that increases his adrenalin could have made it worse.	2348
2627	Buys you whatever you need.	2348
2628	How was the Brazilian?	2347
2629	But if it'll get me the file.	2347
2630	So you guys are trying to manipulate me by playing good cop/good cop?	2346
2631	Hail, hail, the gang's all here.	2346
2632	The patient will punch his wife.	2346
2633	They give out four a day, Max.	2346
2634	The bleeder's got to be in here.	2345
2635	So you just wanted to look pretty on TV.	2345
2636	En the best-intentioned parents end up damaging their kids.	2345
2637	It's brighter in the morning.	2343
2638	The hypothermia could've caused cell necrosis.	2342
2639	Endoscopy didn't reveal any lesions in the small intestine.	2341
2640	You don't look like a Mariel.	2341
2641	But maybe the old paint did.	2341
2642	The patient was punched in the groin.	2340
2643	Have you been married?	2338
2644	We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet.	2338
2645	Maybe the problem isn't a heavy metal from outside.	2337
2646	You mean all of us or just us?	2337
2647	I have the skills to help people.	2336
2648	Are you really leaving medicine?	2336
2649	Notify the dad's sexual partners.	2335
2650	He said he got them playing flag football.	2335
2651	Search the home for toxic plants, methyl bromide, any medications.	2335
2652	Unless I need to say, mother, may I?	2334
2653	If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero.	2334
2654	Made a laceration in the left ventricle about the size of the tip of my index finger.	2333
2655	I just--I just bumped into the wall.	2332
2656	Because, eventually, he'll ask you to cross it.	2331
2657	You're saying he should defer to you?	2330
2658	You said he was at Princeton-Plainsboro?	2329
2659	I thought the bracelet was decorative.	2329
2660	I just--I thought you were moody.	2329
2661	They scraped off the underpass, probably because it contains.	2328
2662	But I need to ask you favor.	2328
2663	The lies she must be telling him.	2327
2664	My boys have a roof over their heads.	2327
2665	Then find someone who does.	2326
2666	Not going back, and that look of shock is elitist and offensive.	2326
2667	The patient was faking?	2326
2668	How many more tricks do you got?	2326
2669	Not sure the amount is relevant.	2325
2670	The E.E.G. didn't show any abnormal brain activity.	2325
2671	Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein.	2324
2672	I'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling and try to make a go of this.	2323
2673	Unfortunately, that's not why we're here.	2323
2674	We need to track down all of them.	2322
2675	I kept trying to talk to him, but before long, he'd forgotten, and he seemed.	2322
2676	Praise for them springing Dad.	2318
2677	You have a wonderful way of communicating.	2317
2678	In fact, I cheated most of you here tonight.	2317
2679	I have to tell my wife the truth.	2316
2680	It means he's not paranoid, is an idiot, and was poisoned.	2316
2681	I heard you're on short time.	2315
2682	At the time, it seemed like a good idea.	2314
2683	You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?	2314
2684	I'm gonna do the surgery.	2313
2685	But delightful, all the same.	2312
2686	I think you should cancel my hearing.	2312
2687	The patient asked me what I thought.	2312
2688	Why didn't you ever tell me?	2310
2689	Even if they are blanks, people'll freak.	2309
2690	I just started back on the team.	2309
2691	The details are just gravy.	2308
2692	House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?	2308
2693	You don't think defying human nature is neurological?	2307
2694	There is a free clinic in Trenton.	2307
2695	You didn't hurt anyone.	2307
2696	You have a bad case of irony.	2306
2697	You have any matches?	2306
2698	Not sure that's-- - What if I bet him $200 I will get fired.	2306
2699	I think you should get a biopsy.	2306
2700	Good for you! You loon.	2305
2701	You like anything dangerous-- monster trucks, motorcycles, fireworks.	2303
2702	Why aren't you more alarmed?	2303
2703	You've got two choices, House.	2303
2704	You'd have to hire me first.	2302
2705	It's the fundamental drive of our species.	2302
2706	But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee.	2301
2707	I guess I'm supposed to be the good cop.	2301
2708	You found one thing you both like or hate.	2301
2709	Were you angry with Dr.	2300
2710	Apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night.	2299
2711	You just got stabbed.	2299
2712	Otherwise, he could be accused of caring.	2298
2713	You really do need psychiatric help.	2298
2714	They'll track down the parents.	2296
2715	You'll figure something out.	2295
2716	You really want to improve things?	2295
2717	Fortunately, only the knife tip reached the cardiac muscle.	2294
2718	the motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.	2294
2719	If you need to talk to someone, a professional.	2293
2720	Looks like you've gone viral, Hon.	2293
2721	Ortho still has the outer office.	2291
2722	He's down in the E.R. right now.	2291
2723	I don't trust you, House.	2291
2724	Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting.	2290
2725	Did you mention what happened?	2290
2726	The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check foany abnormalities.	2289
2727	Do you think people can change?	2288
2728	He sees competing debts with the same person as a disgrace to the game.	2287
2729	It was nice to meet you, Benjamin.	2287
2730	Maybe we should just concentrate on the medicine.	2287
2731	Did House give you homework?	2287
2732	Park, do you have an opening statement.	2285
2733	I was happy watching the fight on pay-per-view.	2285
2734	And that's why I went to Dr.Foreman.	2284
2735	If you stay, we have to have a hearing.	2283
2736	I know how you operate.	2283
2737	You're absolutely right.	2282
2738	I'm happy I knew you.	2282
2739	HPV was covered on the STD panel.	2280
2740	Treat the patient with activated protein c.	2280
2741	We thought it was the salt pork.	2280
2742	Wasn't in the medicine cabinet.	2278
2743	Good thing you made it all official.	2277
2744	When you're facing death.	2277
2745	You have a boyfriend?	2277
2746	I don't think the world's coming to an end.	2276
2747	Guard! You're going into anaphylactic shock.	2275
2748	My God, you have super-human discipline.	2275
2749	Assumed you have a huge penis?	2274
2750	And if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.	2273
2751	Give the kids a kiss for me.	2273
2752	He lost his wife and kids because she couldn't stop giving money away.	2273
2753	You were gonna send me back to prison.	2273
2754	I just got the Ed Wood box set.	2273
2755	Not if the vomiting's persistent.	2272
2756	Tommy's the most popular guy in his office.	2272
2757	You're making a mistake.	2271
2758	Can't hurt to biopsy the rash while we're waiting.	2271
2759	The joke gift, not the cocaine.	2271
2760	Doesn't replace two 'round-the-clock parents.	2270
2761	We won't have the results until the morning.	2269
2762	You do whatever it takes.	2269
2763	I started with 10 million, and I couldn't think of a reason not to give 20.	2269
2764	He used to wear those stupid things all the time.	2269
2765	You don't need to stay.	2267
2766	Are you checking up on me or on House?	2267
2767	They can be pretty hard to detect in people under 50.	2266
2768	The X-ray didn't show any tumors.	2265
2769	You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair.	2263
2770	I cut a deal with the patient.	2262
2771	Stop me whenever you like.	2261
2772	Then we can shock it back into rhythm.	2261
2773	Tox screen tests for metabolites in the urine.	2261
2774	When they die or she dies.	2261
2775	I thought you were gonna go to bed early last night.	2261
2776	Halfway through the perimetry exam, her tunnel vision went away.	2259
2777	You do have to treat me appropriately.	2258
2778	I'm going to admit you.	2258
2779	Ready for the donor lungs.	2257
2780	I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make when the kid wakes up.	2257
2781	Save people's lives instead of just their noses?	2257
2782	I've seen how you disrespect those patients.	2257
2783	They could've moved back.	2256
2784	And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.	2256
2785	He got them playing flag football.	2256
2786	These rug burns are from last night.	2255
2787	You were just a baby.	2255
2788	About the crazy stuff?	2255
2789	My older brother got it at 50.	2255
2790	The guy has earned the right to go to one boxing match.	2254
2791	I think they were happy.	2253
2792	Why'd you really do it?	2253
2793	You think she should?	2253
2794	Make me lose my job by showing you a patient file?	2253
2795	They're willing to come back.	2253
2796	I'm telling the truth.	2252
2797	I can't pay you back.	2251
2798	You have a bit of a rash.	2251
2799	Everybody doesn't lie, cheat, or steal from their friends.	2250
2800	She hasn't even sipped the coffee.	2248
2801	It's the mind's response to a severe trauma.	2248
2802	What do you-- what do you want?	2246
2803	It definitely started with the great mastectomy of 2001.	2245
2804	Second-guessing my best doctors shouldn't be one of them.	2244
2805	Answer the question before answering the door.	2244
2806	You can't argue away my faith.	2243
2807	The change actually makes things simpler.	2243
2808	For the wrong diagnosis.	2243
2809	It's part of the job.	2242
2810	I wouldn't blame anyone if you decide.	2242
2811	What took you so long?	2242
2812	What do you want us to do?	2241
2813	Did you give him sidewalk chalk?	2237
2814	I'm still high in the esophagus.	2237
2815	Do you have a minute?	2237
2816	I got friends on the outside.	2236
2817	Waiting for me at the table.	2235
2818	The symptoms can take up to three days to manifest.	2235
2819	You're still a doctor.	2234
2820	If you double his placebo, he might drown.	2234
2821	Praise for the singing praise for the morning Dad?	2234
2822	We're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this.	2234
2823	She left because of you.	2234
2824	'Cause I wanted you to hear it from me.	2233
2825	Plus, the kid's never been sexually active.	2233
2826	It's a clot in the radicular artery.	2233
2827	He said he understood completely and that I was fired.	2233
2828	Nobody's here to bust you, iris.	2231
2829	The tox screen was clean.	2231
2830	I-I thought it made them deeper somehow.	2230
2831	Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it?	2230
2832	Give them to someone?	2230
2833	Uh, you use it to get food from inside.	2230
2834	She said, I've been a fellow for two months, and I'm kind of weird.	2229
2835	Wait a minute, what's the big deal?	2229
2836	You mean like we should be more optimistic?	2228
2837	But the kid never smoked.	2227
2838	You have unlimited texting.	2226
2839	She wants to go back to the monastery.	2225
2840	The other one's Sophia.	2224
2841	I need you to stop calling me.	2223
2842	Morning has broken like the first morning blackbird has spoken like the first bird Nice tie.	2222
2843	She uses crushed aspirin in the water to make the flowers last longer.	2221
2844	I will be once you just.	2220
2845	Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.	2220
2846	would have my job, my license, maybe even my house, if I do an unauthorized experiment-- But if--if it is masto-- It's not.	2219
2847	I just made you much, much worse.	2219
2848	You're trying to deflect.	2219
2849	Turns out they monitor these monitors.	2219
2850	You're a sucky clown.	2218
2851	He was a character in the Flintsteins.	2217
2852	An untreated schizoid disorder he's finally lost the ability to suppress.	2217
2853	You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew.	2217
2854	Joe, same thing with the engine rebuild.	2216
2855	They're gonna wear off.	2215
2856	The original script was-- - Shh, shh, shh.	2215
2857	You make her feel guilty.	2214
2858	It's the same principle.	2214
2859	It's a synthetic problem.	2213
2860	You never found a career.	2212
2861	Vomiting must have torn the lining.	2212
2862	If you kill him, we're looking at.	2212
2863	Her lymphoma could have been caused by a virus, HTLV-1, which our patient contracted through having sex with his wife.	2212
2864	Syrinx formed in the subarachnoid space, blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.	2211
2865	Where is the construction crew?	2211
2866	It's 3:30 in the morning.	2210
2867	So you treated with steroids.	2210
2868	I thought the patient had normal pressure hydrocephalus.	2209
2869	Might be, if these were actually cheetos' stains.	2209
2870	Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks.	2207
2871	Gave me my brother back.	2207
2872	I don't want to miss the opening bell.	2206
2873	You've been wrong every time.	2206
2874	How are you holding up?	2206
2875	The explosion in the classroom caused the cancer cells to break open.	2205
2876	Except for the again .	2205
2877	They're reacting to something in the plasma.	2203
2878	It's the silence, the contemplation, the order.	2203
2879	I did the same thing many times.	2202
2880	What's the first step?	2202
2881	Pffftt! Then I will come in dead of night Working late?	2201
2882	You're also addicted to puzzles.	2201
2883	What's the action on the ex-wife?	2201
2884	The question is, what explains the liver failure?	2200
2885	I also think that Taub has brought his little taubettes into work with him today.	2200
2886	Isn't that getting this whole parenting thing ass backwards?	2199
2887	Now we're the ones being paranoid.	2199
2888	I think it should give you solace, help you to move on.	2198
2889	It's the stench of moralizing.	2197
2890	But you used to hurt?	2195
2891	The team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation.	2195
2892	It's nothing I can't handle.	2195
2893	You're a creative guy.	2194
2894	Otherwise, I'd still be lying.	2194
2895	You're a changed man.	2194
2896	So why did chelation make the lungs worse?	2193
2897	And that's not a bullet.	2193
2898	You need to log more hours.	2191
2899	You're missing my point.	2190
2900	You're taking my head.	2189
2901	They are kind of boring.	2188
2902	You're in a hospital.	2188
2903	We think we've dealt wit all the liability issues.	2187
2904	Here's the per diem schedules.	2186
2905	What if the lung involvement came first?	2185
2906	You tell me which one's worse.	2184
2907	Unlike you stealing my phone.	2184
2908	I could barely breathe.	2182
2909	The anesthesia's just wearing off.	2182
2910	You allergic to anything?	2180
2911	It's not as bad as a thousand people going down in a gigantic boat, right?	2180
2912	You're moving slower.	2180
2913	You're a smart, successful doctor.	2179
2914	You're such a smart kid.	2178
2915	This is what she was opening when she had her attack.	2178
2916	We'll continue with the medicine.	2177
2917	You're a smart doctor.	2177
2918	only one of you will be in prison.	2177
2919	I can't let you move.	2176
2920	Everyone keeps their jobs.	2175
2921	It was ugly and painful, and she went with me hating her.	2175
2922	S08E05 The Confession By Mikhel for: Subtitulos.	2174
2923	Instead of building bunkers, you should be getting boosters.	2174
2924	He wants me to change my visitation order so he can ask Rachel and my daughter to move out west with him.	2173
2925	A few hours ago you were sure.	2173
2926	The mood swings come on quickly, but, um.	2173
2927	The immunosuppressants we gave him sent it into overdrive.	2172
2928	It's just me telling him he can get away with anything.	2172
2929	You've got one employee, one volunteer.	2172
2930	Could you guys keep it down?	2171
2931	Did you get beaten up on purpose?	2171
2932	He has a lot more to lose than I do, and he knows that.	2170
2933	The tumor interferes with certain natural systems.	2170
2934	You don't believe me?	2169
2935	Almost anything works after boxing, except the word game.	2169
2936	I'm Adele Brown from Social Services, and this is-- I'm Ellen Rogers.	2169
2937	Let's get the lungs on treatment.	2168
2938	To help people the way I always wanted.	2168
2939	All the money's on tumor.	2168
2940	You slept with a nun?	2167
2941	No, I-- if you disagree with Dr.	2167
2942	They did a lateral view as well.	2167
2943	Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.	2166
2944	Um, I had an appointment in this part of town, and I absolutely didn't want to miss this meeting.	2166
2945	You flip-flopped on parental rights.	2166
2946	How many do you want?	2166
2947	No, he thinks they're crucial.	2164
2948	He beat you! What is it?	2164
2949	You know he regained movement.	2164
2950	'Cause next, it'll be three cases, then four.	2162
2951	I thought the patient had a liver problem.	2162
2952	Thought you only had clinic on Tuesdays.	2161
2953	If I wanted you to be like me.	2160
2954	They blew it, didn't they?	2159
2955	The liver failure could be from intraoperative hypotension.	2159
2956	Just betting on myself to solve the case.	2159
2957	So what's the answer?	2159
2958	Tell them we need antitoxin as soon as possible.	2158
2959	Dr.Neusinger canceled on them at the last minute.	2158
2960	Obviously you're Australian.	2157
2961	I found stains on his clothes.	2157
2962	They putting a claim on all of my Vicodin.	2157
2963	I won't tell them anything.	2156
2964	Well, you obviously found something.	2156
2965	No, they were stupid too.	2156
2966	They should be dead by now.	2155
2967	So glad you're on board.	2154
2968	CT confirms no skull fracture, and looking at her confirms she's not 18.	2153
2969	You were ready to do one, as long as you were supervised.	2153
2970	They had banana muffins downstairs.	2153
2971	Since Claudine left, no one's been inputting the numbers.	2151
2972	What the hell is happening to me?	2149
2973	What's the difference?	2149
2974	What if I die, and one day she finds out I cheated on her?	2149
2975	The problem isn't his marrow.	2148
2976	You're using an iPod.	2147
2977	Bright side-- they're probably up weeping.	2146
2978	He needs to constantly establish he's the Alpha dog.	2146
2979	Neither of us is ready to give up on the marriage.	2146
2980	More to it than you think.	2145
2981	He didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?	2145
2982	The classes make him sympathetic.	2144
2983	Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.	2143
2984	Some other nut pulling a scalpel?	2143
2985	He wouldn't even ce to the door a second time.	2142
2986	The E.R. Docs interviewed his wife.	2141
2987	How old do you think I am?	2141
2988	Because that's what every idiot with a bunker full of assault rifles is scared of.	2140
2989	His trachea's blocked below the incision point.	2139
2990	We've got two young kids.	2139
2991	You're pro-infidelity?	2139
2992	You gotta go back to medicine.	2139
2993	Double shifts, just to keep the power on.	2138
2994	So they'll never testify against me.	2137
2995	And do an upper endoscopy to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison, after mommie dearest has given her permission.	2136
2996	Oh, and that was Checkmate, right?	2136
2997	So I can look at them.	2135
2998	I think maybe you should go.	2135
2999	He said you walked out.	2135
3000	No, you don't say no.	2134
3001	Just look at the light.	2134
3002	Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it.	2133
3003	Weaving through the cracks we are simply human Whoops.	2133
3004	Yes, it's a paperweight with a handy storage compartment for .	2132
3005	Only the bleeding's medically relevant.	2132
3006	We need you to show us remorse.	2130
3007	The crew's just starting.	2129
3008	Just drive me to the hospital.	2129
3009	Did you learn anything at Jane Doe's school?	2129
3010	You scare me a little.	2129
3011	I think you should too.	2128
3012	Oh, now, you two make a cute couple.	2128
3013	You just lost my vote.	2127
3014	I didn't hook them up yet.	2126
3015	Plenty of nasty stuff to get into during the middle of the night.	2126
3016	I told you my son didn't do cocaine.	2125
3017	He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.	2125
3018	Never knew you were such a tramp.	2124
3019	They say my liver function's better.	2123
3020	And he was all, 'cause of how Diaz kicked his ass last month.	2122
3021	And an allergic reaction wouldn't get worse three days after he was admitted.	2122
3022	Oh, you don't wanna bet me.	2121
3023	The cure will kill him.	2121
3024	I understand that we're in a hurry but maybe he should.	2120
3025	And when I make more, I'll give that way too.	2120
3026	Is she on the team now?	2120
3027	Well, no, because the interest isn't fake.	2120
3028	He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer.	2119
3029	I already lost one of them.	2118
3030	Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom, it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.	2117
3031	I can't comment on the drunk or the frat.	2113
3032	She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.	2112
3033	Are you trying to annoy us?	2112
3034	One of us is in the wrong time zone.	2112
3035	So you'll let him go?	2112
3036	I knew you were very busy being vaguely important.	2108
3037	He's just more comfortable working with me because he's known me longer.	2108
3038	These abrasions on his knees.	2108
3039	Brother against brother.	2107
3040	Coke never got past the lungs.	2106
3041	Please tell me if you hear anything.	2106
3042	I'd take you if I could.	2105
3043	And I am not ready to give up this.	2104
3044	Don't look at the book.	2104
3045	Explains the neurological impairment as well as the normal blood work.	2103
3046	I borrowed it from one of the nurses.	2103
3047	They ruin everything.	2102
3048	It's not just me and Park.	2101
3049	Get me a micro-vascular clip tray as well as the occlusion.	2100
3050	But don't worry-- it's not gonna end here.	2100
3051	You expecting someone?	2099
3052	Our patient can't wait for a transplant that's never gonna come.	2099
3053	I wanted you to feel better.	2098
3054	I got to get out of here.	2098
3055	Kiddie-winkies! I wonder who they belong to.	2096
3056	No, now they're sore.	2096
3057	How could this be happening to my own daughter without me knowing it?	2095
3058	Which, in turn, in turn, makes you so fired.	2094
3059	Tell him! Do the surgery.	2093
3060	Which idiot did the pregnancy test?	2092
3061	To tell him the truth.	2092
3062	You asking me out on a date?	2091
3063	The bulge in his neck.	2090
3064	At this rate, I'm gonna need to pick out a plot for myself.	2090
3065	These are supposed to be in the computer files.	2090
3066	He's the most rational man I've ever met.	2089
3067	Actually, the difference is pretty much $1 million.	2089
3068	You've seen Spartacus, right?	2089
3069	We try to get you up to 50 words per minute.	2088
3070	Dr.Foreman and I did not always see eye-to-eye.	2088
3071	We're gonna find the dead kid's stash.	2087
3072	I've surfed all over the gold coast.	2087
3073	You weren't trying to undermine my confidence, you were trying to inflate it.	2086
3074	No, then they might stop.	2084
3075	I'll dress 'em the same, like in Vertigo.	2083
3076	Trousseau's syndrome could send clots, cause the ischemic foot.	2082
3077	It's temperature that sets it off, not force.	2081
3078	Means you could stroke.	2080
3079	They're shutting down.	2078
3080	But unless he wakes up before tomorrow, it's gonna be my signature on that piece of paper.	2075
3081	They had to be incredibly high.	2074
3082	Found her sleeping in the park.	2074
3083	Check out the video again.	2072
3084	Then we've got to biopsy.	2071
3085	We all disagree all the time.	2069
3086	You go right back to fun?	2069
3087	Dr.Adams, would you please reach into my pants?	2068
3088	Cultures take time, and his liver doesn't have much left.	2068
3089	Hey, heading out to the yard?	2067
3090	You couldn't round up enough doddering old Guinea pigs.	2067
3091	You were right to push me.	2067
3092	Okay, maybe we need to take a minute here and give Callie some space.	2067
3093	We should call the police.	2065
3094	You are making minimum wage.	2065
3095	Wife keeps the doors on the house locked.	2065
3096	We're in the middle of something.	2065
3097	Upping the nitro should knock it back down.	2065
3098	Wilson needs these lungs.	2063
3099	Which is great, most of the time.	2063
3100	How sick is the patient?	2062
3101	I thought you were referring to talking.	2062
3102	We need to catch the end of our class.	2059
3103	Perhaps you can help us.	2059
3104	They were spectacular.	2058
3105	The lungs are a smoker.	2057
3106	Sticking around the whole time?	2057
3107	Paraneoplastic reaction caused the breathing problems.	2056
3108	When did the discoloration start?	2056
3109	He asked who you were.	2056
3110	Can I see the monitor?	2055
3111	Either a hot tub or a sauna.	2053
3112	We're still working on the lungs.	2053
3113	I tried the outside world.	2052
3114	It wouldn't cross them.	2052
3115	Could that have caused this?	2052
3116	Could the bruising be caused by a physical trauma?	2052
3117	I genuinely wonder who they belong to.	2051
3118	Sir, are you questioning my resolve?	2051
3119	Peek-a-boo! Why would Anita tell her husband about our affair?	2051
3120	After having been rejected explains the clothes.	2050
3121	You want to go back to jail.	2050
3122	You own things you want.	2049
3123	And that's significant why?	2049
3124	They did a bunch of vaccinations, including pneumococcus.	2048
3125	Then why isn't he saturated?	2048
3126	I'd like you to do it.	2046
3127	Or the mom agrees to an autopsy so I can prove it.	2046
3128	He's doing the treatment.	2045
3129	'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something.	2045
3130	I wanted to reassure you.	2045
3131	He coached youth soccer.	2043
3132	No sign of any electrical abnormalities in the right atrium.	2043
3133	Eerily felt like the best-case scenario.	2042
3134	I wanted you to do a tilt table test.	2042
3135	If it's hyperammonemic, toxins will overwhelm his body and he'll go into a coma.	2042
3136	It proved the patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.	2041
3137	You got to work at 9:15.	2040
3138	I shot him in the head.	2039
3139	The bleeding is in her gut.	2039
3140	I breathe it in my soul Is everything okay?	2039
3141	The best dads wait two or more.	2039
3142	No, you wanna like boring.	2037
3143	How's he doing these days?	2037
3144	These are ringside seats.	2036
3145	Awkward! He knocked up two different women at the same time.	2035
3146	See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.	2035
3147	as far as you can prove.	2034
3148	You sound like my daughter.	2034
3149	She asked me to appear on the medical segment.	2032
3150	At the time, it seemed-- - Oh, let me guess.	2032
3151	I should be back on the road in a few minutes.	2032
3152	I was told that this might be my last chance to see my son.	2032
3153	The man she married no longer exists.	2030
3154	They expect a full recovery.	2028
3155	You've got to be kidding me.	2028
3156	We're in the car, honey.	2026
3157	So why the shoulder pain?	2025
3158	If they're hiding inside the lung cells.	2025
3159	We're going to the Doctor's office.	2025
3160	You said you were married.	2024
3161	You were already sick.	2023
3162	You need a girlfriend.	2022
3163	Then we're going home.	2021
3164	They're being relocated.	2021
3165	Diphtheria paralyzing the ocular muscles?	2020
3166	He's the better surgeon.	2020
3167	You got at least a trillion cells.	2020
3168	If the kid had a rash or some circulation issue.	2020
3169	He'll be even more motivated to beat you.	2019
3170	How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?	2017
3171	Taub, you got a minute?	2017
3172	Gain back at least some of the function.	2014
3173	They're also delicious.	2013
3174	Is he sick because of the explosion?	2012
3175	Keep food in the house.	2012
3176	Last thing she ate was strawberry cake, but allergy tests for everything were negative.	2011
3177	Can you do me a favor?	2011
3178	I had it put in during the remodel last year.	2010
3179	Angiography showed a hemorrhagic site in the left lower lobe.	2009
3180	House spoke to the wife.	2008
3181	You've got neighbors.	2008
3182	If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.	2007
3183	We're doing them a favor.	2005
3184	So go back to work at the hospital.	2005
3185	The medical term is cankles.	2004
3186	I eat a lot of cheetos, I forget to wash my hands.	2004
3187	We used to walk and get some every morning at that bakery.	2000
3188	It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss.	1999
3189	Oh, now you wanna help me.	1998
3190	Not that I wasn't struggling with it.	1995
3191	viral infection weakening the wall muscles.	1994
3192	Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.	1992
3193	Who's better qualified to be the daddy?	1992
3194	Almost always hits the kidneys.	1991
3195	One day, I was writing a check to my landscaper, and it suddenly hit me-- $6,000 to take out plants and put in different plants.	1990
3196	Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.	1990
3197	I think you refer to it as petty cash.	1990
3198	you'll go back to prison.	1989
3199	Then go back to neurology.	1988
3200	If you keep being stubborn, he will keep being stubborn.	1987
3201	You were a pretty big deal.	1987
3202	And if he's suspended as a result of this hearing, he violates his parole and he goes back.	1983
3203	I'll go check on the patient.	1983
3204	The kid's our patient.	1981
3205	And I'm not acting out.	1981
3206	You need to watch Norma Rae.	1981
3207	Gotcha! You poor dumb bastard.	1980
3208	It makes you a healthy person.	1980
3209	I think the ledger's clear.	1977
3210	I've decided that I would be doing this hospital a disservice if I did anything to change that process.	1976
3211	I'll make you a counter.	1975
3212	The Mexican pipeline.	1975
3213	Would you read it, please?	1974
3214	The buildup of toxins is causing everything.	1974
3215	One box in the bottom of a closet.	1973
3216	They found the tumor.	1971
3217	It was for our own good, but I don't care.	1971
3218	You should've told me earlier.	1970
3219	You miss, never mention it again.	1969
3220	How's the chelation going?	1969
3221	So I had Park follow you.	1968
3222	I thought of you on mom's birthday.	1968
3223	Those guys made decisions you supported?	1967
3224	We need the nuclear option.	1967
3225	Use the people already on the case.	1967
3226	Start the patient on high-dose steroids.	1966
3227	I just know that I can't live my life feeling like we do.	1965
3228	Oh, you could P.C. up.	1964
3229	A few minutes after I started the IVIG.	1964
3230	He's confident in the diagnosis.	1964
3231	You were CEO since 1988.	1963
3232	The first pair were $120.	1963
3233	Is the problem hyperammonemic or synthetic?	1961
3234	You wanted me to meddle.	1960
3235	the flag football ga.	1960
3236	I used to wait until you went to bed.	1960
3237	Although he can't take on any new clients right now, he's trying to get mean audition for one of those online soaps.	1960
3238	Give me a hand with this.	1959
3239	You manipulated me into doing it.	1959
3240	Plus the ten I got on margin.	1958
3241	The confederates be giving themselves spankin' new tats.	1958
3242	Probably from the diaper bag.	1957
3243	First off, be a decent, empathetic person.	1956
3244	I gave you a good recommendation.	1955
3245	She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her.	1955
3246	Would explain the lack of fever.	1954
3247	The hospital brought in a consultant to work on the lungs.	1954
3248	You may even believe it.	1953
3249	He's moving his company to China, and his employees are hanging him in effigy.	1952
3250	Going overseas a while, and that seems like a huge sacrifice.	1950
3251	They stuck me in catholic school.	1948
3252	One of the sensors came loose.	1947
3253	So who cheated on you?	1947
3254	You saved my life too.	1947
3255	It might help if we knew the question.	1947
3256	How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the man.	1946
3257	The health fair is one of my responsibilities.	1945
3258	You asking 'cause I surf?	1945
3259	I mean, he was closer to Callie than I was, and I missed him.	1944
3260	You mind trying to find me a cricket?	1944
3261	Most people find it easier to ignore the truth.	1936
3262	Put the Vicodin away, Dr.	1936
3263	T.I.A., thickened pericardium, and now he's bleeding from his nose and mouth.	1934
3264	Made in the People's Republic of lead paint.	1934
3265	The guy's potassium is off.	1933
3266	The windows were closed.	1931
3267	Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.	1930
3268	This proves nothing because it's not a gun.	1930
3269	We had to stop the transfusion.	1930
3270	Or do you want to do a cavity search?	1930
3271	Syphilitic vasculitis would explain the T.I.A.	1924
3272	Fungal infection's off the table.	1924
3273	You say pressure, I say inspire.	1924
3274	I like my job, and I'm happy with my life.	1924
3275	How do we explain the STD?	1922
3276	We should probably leave the body in the bag.	1922
3277	The donor had hemosiderosis.	1921
3278	He's worried that too big to fail applies to our banks but not our government.	1921
3279	The prodigal son has returned.	1920
3280	The Board decided to dock me two weeks pay.	1920
3281	See, the metaphors work.	1920
3282	We're doing the tilt table.	1918
3283	Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA.	1916
3284	Construction company in Japan founded in the year 578.	1915
3285	Chlorine gas pools near the ground he thought he'd be safe in the top bunk.	1915
3286	What if she didn't get this from being homeless?	1914
3287	I missed you both so much.	1913
3288	Very interesting practice you must've run.	1912
3289	Yes, it gives you a responsibility.	1912
3290	Then animal ghost cases.	1911
3291	Now that we know what it is, he'll need treatment, but he'll live.	1911
3292	You'd better be fast.	1910
3293	Will the endoscopy be painful?	1909
3294	Some cute young nurse baked you cookies?	1909
3295	Let's try the medication first.	1909
3296	See you tomorrow morning.	1909
3297	I say we tell the kid.	1909
3298	I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.	1908
3299	You must be somebody.	1906
3300	My kids loved the massage bed.	1904
3301	No you, no medicine, no fixing people.	1904
3302	An entire hospital betting on the legitimacy of my kids?	1903
3303	Lying to the patient.	1903
3304	We're going to the cath lab?	1902
3305	You said it hurt a bit.	1902
3306	Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?	1901
3307	You said, blah blah blah blah blah, deaf ears, blah blah blah blah blah.	1901
3308	We're close to the point of no return.	1900
3309	And that is exactly what happened.	1899
3310	Encephalitis makes his brain swell, which causes symptoms that are hard to distinguish from his Alzheimer's.	1899
3311	Never mind Bride of the Monster.	1899
3312	I started the last round of pleconaril.	1898
3313	Sis and I were talking, trying to figure out how many hospital sleepovers we've had.	1898
3314	Explains the negatives of the blood disorder.	1898
3315	You saved a man's life.	1895
3316	You ever heard of dark matter?	1892
3317	As it grew larger, so did the confessions.	1892
3318	And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea.	1892
3319	That's an insult to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.	1890
3320	You hate ice cream too?	1885
3321	Discharge the patient.	1884
3322	'Cause the market opens at 9:00 a.	1884
3323	Do you remember being hurt?	1883
3324	I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs.	1883
3325	The bleeding stopped on its own.	1883
3326	I heard the nurses talking.	1882
3327	I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.	1881
3328	Repeat this, no ifs, ands, or buts.	1879
3329	Or maybe the reverse is true.	1877
3330	ARDS secondary to trauma is our leading hypothesis.	1874
3331	And I mean that metaphorically, of course.	1874
3332	Also explains the motorcycle crash.	1873
3333	Boo-yah! Pfft! Boo-yah to you too.	1873
3334	You used Adams' shampoo.	1873
3335	And I think that's great.	1872
3336	The sound I make is, moooo! The sound I make is, quack quack quack quack quack.	1872
3337	I know this is hard, but please tell me exactly what happened next.	1871
3338	You look healthy, so.	1870
3339	Said the divorced woman to the divorced man.	1870
3340	I'll try the marrow registry.	1869
3341	He grabbed it, he apologized for grabbing it, and now he's taking classes because he grabbed it.	1868
3342	So you wanna research it?	1865
3343	You owe me a new pair of pants.	1864
3344	Vomiting stopped after the E.	1863
3345	It's all bought and paid for.	1862
3346	Wife of the groundskeeper.	1862
3347	The antitoxin is working.	1862
3348	And if we induce v-fib, odds say that we'll be able to revive him.	1860
3349	Give me the full $200,000.	1860
3350	Massive amounts choke up the lungs.	1858
3351	to give it to the same lady?	1854
3352	The game started at 7:00.	1854
3353	You ever hear of Kongo Gumi?	1853
3354	I don't care what killed him! It's called Alport syndrome.	1853
3355	You went to my school.	1852
3356	My dad left me alone to care for my alcoholic mom and raise my baby sister.	1851
3357	It amounts to the same thing.	1851
3358	See if I can handle working with him.	1850
3359	We would have had to biopsy his lymph nodes anyway to check for cancer.	1849
3360	Pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population.	1849
3361	Clearly, you suck at it.	1846
3362	People understand getting hit more than what my mom does.	1845
3363	Shut up, you lying sack of crap.	1844
3364	I'll do the flushing.	1843
3365	Reasonable theory, supported by the evidence.	1843
3366	Please read the highlighted text at the bottom of the page.	1843
3367	That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	1842
3368	depends upon the use of a team.	1842
3369	Pinto stat to the cath lab.	1841
3370	My team is confirming the diagnosis as we speak.	1838
3371	And his urine and blood tests didn't show any evidence of an adrenaline-secreting tumor.	1837
3372	I'm told that some people are just nice.	1837
3373	I mean, in the guest room.	1837
3374	As soon as you leave, I am.	1836
3375	Nice to meet you, Dr.	1835
3376	If the plumbing's fine, check the electrical.	1834
3377	Blood smear was clear, and we idiots treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.	1834
3378	You asked me to ask you.	1832
3379	I spoke to the head of neurology in Chicago.	1831
3380	Cauterized the ulcer, stopped the bleeding.	1830
3381	Dr.Park is searching the registry.	1829
3382	Sex drive is in the brain.	1829
3383	Explains the bleeding.	1828
3384	In addition to the multiple personalities?	1827
3385	The test is negative.	1827
3386	I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned house with mold.	1826
3387	No one in mom's family's a match, and as far as she knows, dad has no living relatives.	1825
3388	You do it through policy.	1825
3389	We belong to the same club.	1825
3390	We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.	1824
3391	We killed part of the lung.	1823
3392	2011 is the bicentennial of their birth.	1821
3393	And come down come down innocent way of life Bikes go faster without training wheels.	1819
3394	Life with mom and dad was kind of a drag.	1817
3395	Or the neighbor's hot wife.	1816
3396	My college roommate is the editor of the Yale Law Review.	1816
3397	Most medication exacerbates the condition.	1816
3398	I got an order here to deactivate and remove his ankle monitor.	1815
3399	Draw up a little anesthetic.	1814
3400	Here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition.	1813
3401	Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.	1812
3402	Turn to an inch to the left.	1812
3403	And on a personal note, if my actions caused anyone distress, I sincerely apologize.	1810
3404	It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.	1810
3405	My job is to be the jerk.	1809
3406	Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis and cerebral arteritis.	1809
3407	My sister ended up drinking half of her life away and hating me because I couldn't help.	1809
3408	We watched the Devils demolish the Rangers.	1808
3409	You owe me 106,804 won.	1808
3410	You felt oxygen depravation.	1806
3411	We removed the artery.	1806
3412	And if it's not a clot?	1805
3413	It must be the descending branch.	1804
3414	Approaching the clot.	1804
3415	The illness is alcohol-related.	1803
3416	We also need to confirm and treat whatever's making him sick.	1802
3417	The evidence pointed to psychosis.	1802
3418	In the pool is the neighbor's daughter.	1799
3419	But that's what white blood cells are.	1798
3420	Chris Christie recommends the pancakes.	1797
3421	Release the best actors?	1793
3422	I'm pretty sure that's not sexist.	1793
3423	Taub is interrogating the janitor.	1792
3424	Check the ventricles.	1792
3425	And when did he learn that?	1791
3426	Add the enlarged lymph node, macrocytosis.	1790
3427	He has no heartbeat, and he's not breathing.	1789
3428	Middle third of the neck.	1787
3429	This is outlandishly childish.	1786
3430	The math is pretty basic.	1785
3431	Monitor the aneurysm.	1784
3432	The technical term is slow.	1784
3433	Lighten the anesthesia.	1783
3434	And it's not a fight.	1781
3435	Goes to the witness's credibility.	1781
3436	My car is in the shop.	1781
3437	I made a mistake, and now it's gonna end up ruining my life.	1780
3438	because it's not that strong.	1779
3439	Well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game.	1777
3440	The rivets go pop, I slide in the heating pad.	1775
3441	Apathetic hyperthyroidism.	1774
3442	Where are we going now I'm not going to Chicago.	1773
3443	No pesticides, fertilizers, or fuel in the garage.	1773
3444	It's just really hard doing this by myself.	1773
3445	No enhancement on the MRI.	1773
3446	Increase the steroid dose.	1772
3447	Moving on to the G.E. junction.	1770
3448	I admire the creativity.	1767
3449	That would mean that every symptom after his T.I.A. was a coincidence.	1767
3450	I spoke to the prioress.	1766
3451	Hence the attire, hence the tardiness.	1766
3452	Like some part of him gets what he's putting his wife through, so he tried to-- kill himself?	1765
3453	Six years ago, I was a nanny in Honolulu for this beautiful two-year-old boy.	1764
3454	Dead patients usually get a lower standard of care.	1763
3455	That was to show Adams that mommie dearest hadn't changed.	1761
3456	Is it the electrodes?	1761
3457	This is just messing with my feng shui here.	1758
3458	But daddy is weak and needs to know.	1758
3459	I say we put him out of his misery and bring out Emma's cake.	1758
3460	And it's still his company.	1754
3461	That I can get out of here soon.	1753
3462	He means it's not lemierre's, but it's still an infection, which is why it's spreading so rapidly.	1749
3463	But it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.	1749
3464	House has to believe that I have authority over him.	1746
3465	That's why I did this.	1742
3466	Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago.	1737
3467	And MS and vasculitis usually get better with pregnancy.	1736
3468	That's how daddy likes to spend his time too.	1736
3469	We can't talk about this case anymore.	1725
3470	I was gonna leave that implied, but, yes, colossal drunk.	1723
3471	He believes that disagreement and mistrust lead to better ideas.	1723
3472	If everyone did that, we'd never find a donor for anyone again.	1722
3473	I was eating a baby for lunch, and.	1719
3474	Could indicate a problem with his heart, which would-- - EKG was normal.	1718
3475	And I was all, how come?	1718
3476	I thought it was interesting she couldn't accept that coffee.	1717
3477	But I didn't want to, and he got mad.	1715
3478	Finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night.	1707
3479	Just gonna put this right here.	1706
3480	Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast.	1704
3481	I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.	1700
3482	This is all that's left.	1699
3483	It's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who deserves it.	1698
3484	I was just getting to that part.	1698
3485	Asthma-induced pneumothorax would and might not show up on a posteroanterior X-ray.	1697
3486	He's not gonna like this.	1696
3487	And any minor infection could have caused those.	1696
3488	No, he said, I'm a drunk idiot who thinks he can grab girls' behinds without ramifications.	1695
3489	And how exactly is that my fault?	1693
3490	It's a very expensive machine, and I'd like it back.	1692
3491	No, but House has been talking about how badly he wants to remove those prison tats.	1692
3492	That's naive and sick.	1691
3493	That's not what I said.	1691
3494	But that's as low as I'm gonna go.	1690
3495	Regular stock this time, nice and safe.	1690
3496	And I knew that meant making certain sacrifices.	1688
3497	I hope this isn't going where I assume it's going.	1684
3498	Hey, thanks for doing this in here.	1684
3499	I'm not emotionally involved with her.	1682
3500	What's wrong with me?	1680
3501	I can't ask someone to do that for me.	1679
3502	Every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection is time we could be treating him.	1671
3503	And this means a lot to me.	1671
3504	No, that's serious contraband.	1668
3505	I'm not saying I don't have faith.	1668
3506	Notify his employer, his landlord.	1665
3507	Well, I can't just leave this up to her.	1665
3508	At least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did because we're not doing anything.	1661
3509	That means he didn't get in trouble for drinking.	1652
3510	Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect.	1652
3511	I'm an ex-con trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by.	1651
3512	I think we should talk about Lena's grandchildren.	1650
3513	His company's moving him back to Portland.	1648
3514	Monitor his brain activity, start a continuous urineest and blood draws every two hours.	1648
3515	I ordered a bunch of random tests to keep him here.	1642
3516	His wife wasn't even here when he hallucinated.	1641
3517	He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.	1640
3518	And check Chase for testosterone.	1640
3519	He was given fluids, and he got better.	1637
3520	After he broke out, I wanted to confirm it was gluten before we dosed him.	1635
3521	If I get this done in five minutes, she won't stroke out.	1634
3522	This woman's life is probably better off without sex.	1632
3523	Tell him to keep his hand off me.	1631
3524	I have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts by husbands, wives, parents.	1630
3525	Yeah, but he didn't know that.	1630
3526	Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.	1630
3527	Actually, it's something that comes up often.	1628
3528	He's an addict, and he will put himself back in jail over a puzzle.	1626
3529	That's why I would like her sister to live near my home.	1626
3530	And what if I have a kid?	1623
3531	And now everybody's talking about it.	1616
3532	He's also dreamy, but it's not relevant now.	1614
3533	And could, but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes.	1614
3534	Is it okay for me to walk away from that because I.	1613
3535	And I barely even have $100 and.	1607
3536	What causes an ear bleed, breathing problems, and our runaway's inability to run away?	1601
3537	Phil had something that he would like to say, so I thought that he should say it in person.	1593
3538	That woman sees everything to do with her daughter through.	1593
3539	I think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum-- which will kill him if it's a GAD autoimmunity.	1591
3540	Husband have her tonight?	1590
3541	And nothing seems to help.	1589
3542	A year after that, he started forgetting things.	1586
3543	Need some droperidol in here! I gotta go! He was hallucinating he was being attacked by bears.	1586
3544	Ooh, I mean, that's pricy, but it can be done.	1584
3545	Not dead until he's warm and dead.	1584
3546	Mini-mental, CT, and get a hair sample to check for past cocaine use.	1583
3547	I have enough problems with this job.	1579
3548	Good afternoon, Cedarville! It is my distinct honor to present our annual community service award to one of our most outstanding citizens.	1577
3549	Hey! House, open up! This is a direct order! Yeah, it's always a direct order.	1577
3550	For what I'm about to do.	1577
3551	Well, I guess that's good enough for prison work.	1576
3552	I can work with people who've got nowhere else to go.	1576
3553	Decided to have an all-night game in Brandon Broome's basement.	1575
3554	We have time for one more test before we move him.	1575
3555	And her shoulder pain is all gone.	1575
3556	House, she really needs this kidney.	1574
3557	House, if it's total paralysis, he must have-- not necessarily.	1574
3558	So all parents screw up all children, but it makes some huge difference if I keep my daughter here or let her move?	1574
3559	I'm beginning to think we should just go with House's idea.	1573
3560	Probably spent more time with him than his own parents.	1573
3561	He's probably not eating all that healthy.	1571
3562	So we discussed it a little longer, and House decided to treat with Heparin.	1559
3563	It's called Alice in Wonderland syndrome.	1557
3564	And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag.	1556
3565	That could have happened to anyone.	1555
3566	I have to live with this too.	1553
3567	I'm sure she understands.	1553
3568	House's comments will, of course, have no bearing on this hearing.	1553
3569	It's a little late for that.	1552
3570	We can't treat an underage patient without a guardian-- we need to call Social Services.	1549
3571	He was okay with that?	1548
3572	'Cause I'm vain and shallow.	1547
3573	Not sure what this is.	1545
3574	But I can't live like this.	1544
3575	He'll notice it eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.	1543
3576	Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving, but not this fast.	1541
3577	He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.	1539
3578	I told him to tell his wife he cheated, not confess every sin he's ever committed.	1535
3579	He didn't get that name because he's a fan of Santa's reindeer.	1535
3580	Joseph helps me with my husband sometimes.	1532
3581	My heart will go on House, I haven't forgotten our friendship.	1532
3582	Married one's not a keeper, but it's a start.	1522
3583	I never heard of a neurological problem that causes someone's skin to fall off.	1521
3584	It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.	1521
3585	He's never hit her before or lost all his English.	1519
3586	Or it's GAD, and we started treatment too late.	1519
3587	We're trying to find money in our budget so we don't have to move our operations overseas.	1518
3588	We should do a mental status examination and get a CT of his basel ganglia.	1516
3589	That's what I just said.	1515
3590	Now, let's get this over with.	1514
3591	I shudder to think what that world would be like.	1513
3592	Not enough to test abnormal, just more than his brain is used to.	1510
3593	I was crying, and he couldn't drive.	1509
3594	Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option.	1509
3595	I'm sorry about earlier, but we needed to provoke a reaction.	1504
3596	I'm just looking for something more.	1504
3597	I-I did something stupid last night, but it was a one-time thing.	1503
3598	But I'm glad it's going to someone.	1501
3599	This chair will help me do that.	1500
3600	Stuff like what employers are looking for, how to turn negatives into positives.	1496
3601	And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better.	1494
3602	I just can't do this anymore.	1493
3603	That's not gonna help.	1493
3604	I'm not seeing an embryo anywhere.	1490
3605	We had a patient who was going to die without an AVM embolization.	1487
3606	He never eats or drinks anything that we haven't made at home.	1486
3607	That's not from a fungal infection.	1485
3608	His thyroid levels were within normal range when he was admitted.	1484
3609	Started with a condom, and we kept it going with our gloves and equipment.	1477
3610	Alvarez, look at what I'm doing! It's a tracheotomy.	1477
3611	That's not supposed to happen, right?	1477
3612	I tried to learn when we got married, but I just-- it's okay.	1474
3613	We're not gonna tell him he was molested?	1472
3614	What if it's not an allergic reaction?	1465
3615	It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.	1465
3616	Check his TSH levels and get a sleep study.	1459
3617	And during about nine years of previous cases.	1456
3618	Yeah, well, not this time.	1453
3619	Carotid dissection, four-inch pulsatile mass in her neck, and some Broca's aphasia.	1451
3620	And here's a bigger one.	1451
3621	Ah, shut it off! Apparently we're allowed to do this now.	1449
3622	Well, I know that Jesus walked on water but.	1449
3623	is this really about a woman?	1448
3624	I hung it up because someone had to run this place after cuddy left.	1448
3625	It's not bad for a day's work.	1445
3626	His heartbeat's doing well, and his body temperature is stabilized.	1442
3627	Nah, that's not gonna do it.	1441
3628	It'll raise his temperature enough that his heart should naturally start.	1441
3629	That's why all parents screw up all children.	1440
3630	I just gotta do a standard battery of tests.	1440
3631	100 bucks says I can find a medical reason why she doesn't want to have sex.	1439
3632	I'm guessing he does things like that a lot.	1438
3633	This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid.	1437
3634	I'm gonna need that too.	1436
3635	I could feel better about that.	1435
3636	He's been alone all this time.	1431
3637	I bet House $100 that I wouldn't get fired after my disciplinary hearing.	1431
3638	I'm actually thinking of just getting my ged.	1430
3639	Ben, I-I don't think that's a good idea.	1429
3640	Yeah, I know it's a rationalization, but it went a long way to making me feel.	1424
3641	House didn't even know he was coming back.	1424
3642	Not all migraines present that way.	1423
3643	What did he do when he was here?	1421
3644	Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL levels rise.	1419
3645	I want and need parents.	1414
3646	24-year-oldwater treatment worker with pyrexia and double vision.	1414
3647	We've talked about it a lot, and.	1414
3648	I pay court-ordered child support, and, frankly, it's, uh.	1414
3649	That's what those guns are.	1413
3650	But my department got defunded, and.	1410
3651	This unfortunate stabbing incident is officially nobody's fault.	1410
3652	At least I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.	1409
3653	He'd have his own words for everything.	1409
3654	But Chang and Eng were both, in fact, born in Siam.	1404
3655	I--I can't get all 20, but once I get out-- Give us a minute.	1402
3656	I take it it's not at a place with a big top.	1401
3657	She lives at her mom's now on account that she lost her job.	1395
3658	I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.	1393
3659	That's why Drew made up his own words.	1393
3660	Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage to wash 'em out with water.	1391
3661	A chemistry demonstration he was doing for his class went wrong.	1389
3662	I already told Foreman he'd been drinking that night.	1386
3663	That last one may not be universal.	1385
3664	I'm more clever and more devious.	1383
3665	It's a genetic condition characterized by kidney failure, bronchial myomas, Mees' lines, and deafness.	1381
3666	FiO2 is 93%-- Prison! Sorry I thought I heard everyone else think that.	1377
3667	Could he know I'm good with a gun?	1376
3668	So I'm just lying about everything?	1376
3669	At least, that's what I've been told.	1375
3670	It's his heart we're worried about.	1373
3671	Which means it's too late for me to back down.	1373
3672	Any chance that could happen before 9:00?	1372
3673	It is crazy, but House doesn't do crazy just for crazy's sake.	1372
3674	I'm sorry about before.	1372
3675	This was House's idea.	1371
3676	It's never actually been used before.	1369
3677	Couldn't have caught a virus while he was outside.	1369
3678	But, out of an abundance of caution, my colleague has taken it upon herself to do one more test.	1367
3679	I'm not looking for excitement.	1365
3680	No, I'm not agreeing to anything until I talk to her.	1365
3681	This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?	1363
3682	Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.	1362
3683	Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.	1361
3684	He was giving me a ride home, and.	1361
3685	Because his symptoms point towards an infection that spread to his brain.	1360
3686	Get Black Beauty and meet me out front.	1359
3687	It explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.	1359
3688	Honey, I don't understand.	1359
3689	Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?	1358
3690	How long can I assume that he's been smoking?	1355
3691	It's up and running again.	1354
3692	I just--I just got jostled a little, that's it.	1353
3693	It's got to be a clot keeping her from bleeding out.	1353
3694	That should be enough for all of us.	1351
3695	I know that sounds weird, but.	1349
3696	We'll check catecholamines for pheo and run an expanded opioid panel.	1347
3697	I never said that wasn't possible.	1347
3698	I miss my wife, but it's not driving my decision-making.	1346
3699	Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring.	1345
3700	And if she says she has been vaccinated?	1342
3701	I'm doing my job, part of which is to make sure House does his.	1342
3702	And what's brown mean?	1342
3703	Which means he's both irascible and stupid.	1339
3704	Ray! Let's just get out of here, okay?	1339
3705	We needed a treatment that was a.	1337
3706	I've had dreams about this.	1336
3707	That's not a very shameful walk of shame.	1336
3708	Now, usually with hyperviscosity syndrome, it's caused by an elevated blood count or protein count.	1335
3709	Means this donation was given under duress.	1332
3710	Yes, I-- I did have some pictures on that.	1332
3711	I've been waiting my entire life for that.	1330
3712	From here who can we trust I wonder what happens now.	1330
3713	We're still waiting for that jell-o delivery.	1330
3714	Here's what I'm thinking.	1328
3715	No about it and no ifs.	1327
3716	Probably also believes that he thinks Salma Hayek's breasts are too big.	1327
3717	Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.	1327
3718	It's a good thing that worked.	1326
3719	Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding.	1324
3720	I-I checked online, and it's.	1323
3721	She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells.	1323
3722	Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D. in physics.	1321
3723	That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.	1321
3724	I don't see how that's possible.	1320
3725	Thanks, but I got a lot of work I need to get done.	1319
3726	Just so much and no more.	1319
3727	I'm sorry, I'm not making any sense right now.	1319
3728	Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues.	1317
3729	I would never do something like that.	1317
3730	Laffont, that's only because we temporarily shut down our Diagnostics Department.	1316
3731	Those who can move on, and those who can't.	1313
3732	Not quite sure what box to check here.	1312
3733	Mommy gets a rest, daddy gets more time with his little angel.	1312
3734	House, we gotta evacuate this area.	1311
3735	That's not an answer.	1309
3736	That's what those vitamin pills were.	1309
3737	actually, why didn't I do that?	1308
3738	I've been waiting to do this for months.	1306
3739	So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen.	1305
3740	He can fight this off if we give him a chance.	1305
3741	She could have listened to me about my drinking.	1305
3742	That's a side effect of not dying.	1305
3743	First admit that I was right.	1304
3744	It's med-speak for she's an idiot.	1303
3745	She wants nothing to do with Drew's death.	1301
3746	I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's.	1301
3747	I'm not a doctor anymore, House.	1299
3748	I think she might make it this time.	1299
3749	It's for his own good.	1298
3750	Might actually contribute to that reaction.	1298
3751	And no one in town is ever gonna speak to me again.	1298
3752	Foreman's not gonna back down.	1298
3753	No one gave me a handout.	1297
3754	Yeah, but not for protection.	1297
3755	His ICP was not normal.	1295
3756	She doesn't seem to like that idea.	1293
3757	ed and I had to clean her up and put her in bed.	1293
3758	Anyway, he'd be getting better right now, not worse.	1293
3759	I know how to take someone's pain away, how to make a stopped heart beat again.	1292
3760	But we'll get through this.	1291
3761	Not unless that file has a file in it.	1290
3762	It's extreme and reckless.	1290
3763	We gotta get her BP up before her organs start shutting down.	1289
3764	She's not long term because she has no long term.	1288
3765	It's consistent with all of her symptoms.	1288
3766	Is that, like, a synonym for clever ?	1288
3767	Doctor's right about that.	1287
3768	If we both do our jobs, we might actually get him through his parole.	1283
3769	His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.	1283
3770	Everyone had already refused to work on that case.	1282
3771	Okay, cross out everything that doesn't appear in every alter.	1282
3772	Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.	1280
3773	Did okay before that.	1278
3774	I'm not really an affair guy after all.	1276
3775	Funded and staffed his own department.	1276
3776	But he's really excited about representing me.	1275
3777	I don't know when I'm coming back.	1274
3778	That doesn't mean I have a problem.	1274
3779	Been in and out of rehab, ve up clowning.	1273
3780	He thought that was stupid too.	1272
3781	Patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.	1272
3782	All right, this is getting annoying.	1270
3783	We need to get reckless and extreme.	1270
3784	This is coming from a man whose eyes are wide open.	1267
3785	Did someone come take her for a test?	1265
3786	Hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	1265
3787	I'm proud to have been a part of it, but.	1265
3788	His liver was in shock before.	1264
3789	I'm just disagreeing, not overruling.	1263
3790	Now shut up and let's see if he has an attack.	1261
3791	But this could also be pesticide poisoning.	1261
3792	Please just let me get out of here.	1259
3793	Why doesn't Chase have to be here?	1258
3794	I, uh, have this terrible pain in my left shoulder.	1257
3795	This guy went on walkabout.	1257
3796	Is that what he called it?	1256
3797	Check out our new brand, huh?	1255
3798	But now that I accept that, I feel much less conflicted.	1254
3799	Hey, that is not okay.	1252
3800	It was a controlled reaction that went a little haywire.	1251
3801	This is a C.T. scan of his liver from ten hours ago.	1250
3802	I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.	1250
3803	I just don't know what to do.	1250
3804	I don't think it was his fault.	1250
3805	Excess adrenaline can cause heart problems and.	1250
3806	Wilson says it's not breast cancer.	1247
3807	Treat with Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid.	1247
3808	All those knives and needles.	1246
3809	That is nothing to be ashamed of.	1246
3810	Used to have to pretend I was scared.	1246
3811	does this look like a good time?	1245
3812	Lowering his libido and causing erectile dysfunction.	1244
3813	Because I wanted to get out of here.	1243
3814	This is a waste of time.	1243
3815	It was really hard with those stupid little sunglasses.	1242
3816	Who cares if House was callous?	1242
3817	Damn! I just realized I'm late for my anger management class.	1241
3818	Mr.Chips's owner only feeds him on apples and bananas.	1240
3819	And she needs an LVAD.	1239
3820	But not guilty enough to stop seeing her.	1239
3821	I ruled out heart attack and anxiety disorder.	1237
3822	But that's only experimental.	1237
3823	Supposed to talk to his P.O. about getting his ankle monitor off early.	1237
3824	Probably not contagious at this point.	1235
3825	I don't think we actually have much of a case.	1233
3826	God, this is exactly what I needed.	1231
3827	Got a problem with that, fire me.	1229
3828	This hearing isn't about me, Dr.	1227
3829	What was wrong with me?	1226
3830	As in routine vaccines against stuff that is actually scary.	1226
3831	He didn't understand and he didn't seem traumatized.	1223
3832	Remember we talked about this?	1223
3833	But I'm not-- I'm not an alcoholic.	1222
3834	It's this new curve control thing.	1220
3835	He'll probably die of boredom long before that.	1219
3836	I'm not coming back, House.	1218
3837	But what about compromising it in a minor way?	1217
3838	I'm sorry I lied, but-- I know, okay.	1216
3839	Is it possible that she hurt her shoulder?	1215
3840	If it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.	1213
3841	Just wrong about what?	1213
3842	We can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.	1212
3843	Shouldn't I use that money to do something important?	1210
3844	This is working fine for me.	1208
3845	Charges of child exploitation against American companies have been blown way out of proportion.	1207
3846	Blood count and protein count are normal.	1207
3847	What is this, Canada?	1206
3848	That was 12 years ago.	1205
3849	And I don't own a gun.	1205
3850	Pull! Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action.	1204
3851	maybe get suspended and.	1203
3852	Since I have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him.	1202
3853	I don't think it was anyone's fault.	1202
3854	That mass wasn't a tumor.	1200
3855	And it only has 12 hours left.	1199
3856	Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious.	1196
3857	Oh, I have to take this.	1195
3858	No ifs, ands, or buts.	1194
3859	I get why he wants to go to that fight.	1194
3860	It's actually not such a big deal.	1194
3861	Try not to kill anyone else until I get back.	1193
3862	I'm just glad it's over.	1192
3863	It's like it wasn't even me.	1192
3864	If it's an infection, we'll kill him for sure.	1191
3865	Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her.	1189
3866	Considering I don't work here, arguably, I'm early.	1188
3867	I'm here for Vanessa.	1188
3868	It's good for a couple to share a hobby.	1186
3869	I wanted to spend my life with him, but.	1185
3870	We need to lavage before she drowns in her own blood.	1185
3871	His liver's not cleaning out his blood.	1185
3872	Pulmonology was that way.	1184
3873	And alkalinize his urine.	1183
3874	Cocaine abuse can cause paranoia and chest pain.	1182
3875	This is not an exact process.	1182
3876	Bobby was very insistent on that point.	1181
3877	His body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk.	1179
3878	We just need to know what happened.	1178
3879	That is, if I'm right.	1178
3880	What was his heart rate?	1178
3881	He just held my hand.	1177
3882	Just sitting and praying.	1176
3883	That was pure luck too.	1175
3884	It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.	1175
3885	I thought that was Nadine.	1174
3886	Right now's not a good time, House.	1172
3887	It's what I'd do if I were him.	1172
3888	His house is not gonna be low priority.	1172
3889	I'm not working, House.	1171
3890	How did that turn out?	1170
3891	So this was a team-building exercise?	1170
3892	Fridge has more spinach and broccoli than a farmer's market.	1165
3893	Well, now that we've got that completely behind us.	1160
3894	We got about five minutes till pinto gets back.	1160
3895	Lawyers say I'm not allowed to.	1159
3896	He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.	1157
3897	Thought she just got here.	1156
3898	So he just walked out?	1156
3899	Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal.	1155
3900	It's not diagnostically relevant.	1155
3901	But not his swollen lymph notes.	1154
3902	And he's always self-destructive.	1153
3903	No, I'm just going through a bit of withdrawal.	1152
3904	That's what he implied.	1152
3905	Not looking for anything serious.	1151
3906	What would House want with a skin resurfacing laser?	1151
3907	Nobody knows I'm here.	1150
3908	It's not dangerous because it's not a gun.	1150
3909	She gave up her life to take care of him.	1149
3910	I don't know if I'm coming back.	1149
3911	Now, that has baggage stamped all over it.	1144
3912	And I do mean rule out.	1144
3913	This is a little scary for me.	1144
3914	Wh-what if I had a history with, uh.	1142
3915	Boy meets girl, girl falls for boy, boy says, I'm asexual.	1141
3916	None of his samples test positive for anything.	1140
3917	I would have gone with colossal drunk.	1140
3918	That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.	1140
3919	I need to get a jump on this thing.	1139
3920	Especially since my husband died.	1139
3921	Analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.	1138
3922	But if it's completely clotted, it may indicate cancer.	1136
3923	A vitamin K deficiency or scurvy could explain bleeding problems, and pregnancy could exacerbate it.	1135
3924	I'm running a special on grilled cheese this week.	1135
3925	I got to get out of here, okay?	1135
3926	Shouldn't we be trying to maximize what we can save here?	1135
3927	I don't wanna start any rumors, but-- But what?	1134
3928	What if she got it from her mom?	1133
3929	Kapur and Carlyle are unavailable.	1133
3930	This all started when he cheated on his wife.	1133
3931	House, it's not a symptom.	1132
3932	His family history of melanoma may have affected his cellular outlook.	1131
3933	House not attach importance to patient histories?	1130
3934	I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.	1130
3935	It's where we had our first date.	1130
3936	Because this is a bad idea, House.	1129
3937	That's what I object to.	1128
3938	I'm not done testifying.	1127
3939	I'm talking to this agent.	1126
3940	What fun would that be?	1125
3941	Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw.	1125
3942	I can't take care of him anymore.	1123
3943	He must think that I hired him to attack.	1122
3944	Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fever.	1121
3945	That's already ruled out.	1121
3946	Yeah, I guess I was just going by how it looks.	1121
3947	She's throwing away her life because of blind faith.	1120
3948	Something very obvious and very boring.	1119
3949	Yes, I was on call for neurology.	1118
3950	I'm consulting on this case.	1118
3951	And maybe starting to go away.	1118
3952	Goes to school and makes good grades.	1117
3953	I'm going to that fight.	1117
3954	His symptoms have gone away.	1116
3955	I asked him to meet me here for a family reunion.	1113
3956	I'll take this outside.	1112
3957	Bring her in and pack her nose.	1112
3958	Sorry to show up like this.	1111
3959	Don't want to explain this twice.	1109
3960	Just tell me what's safe to inject in his thigh.	1109
3961	And completely divorced from humanity.	1108
3962	I don't think Emory wants to share right now.	1108
3963	I just came for a chat with a friend.	1107
3964	His company's lost one third of its value since he was admitted.	1107
3965	That comes with a rash.	1105
3966	If I have to plough that furrow myself, so be it.	1102
3967	He's destroying thousands of jobs.	1102
3968	Big sinus bleed could be sinusitis and a bleeding disorder.	1101
3969	It stumped two E.R. Docs and an immunologist from Johns Hopkins.	1097
3970	I'm not loaning my boss money.	1097
3971	I'd love to go myself, which is kind of why I have to stop him.	1096
3972	Stumped three internists and a department chair from Harvard.	1096
3973	That counts for a lot.	1094
3974	This case boils down to he said, she said.	1094
3975	So that's really weird.	1093
3976	Why would I do this now?	1091
3977	Oh, no, wait-- that's her.	1091
3978	It's all about common ground.	1090
3979	Cuddy's not here anymore.	1089
3980	I'm short on cash this month.	1088
3981	But every unit of plasma can have up to 25 contributing donors.	1088
3982	I don't know how, but.	1088
3983	Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation.	1087
3984	It was a two-for-one sale.	1087
3985	A life of perpetual enclosure and almost complete silence?	1085
3986	I spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision.	1085
3987	I'm not allergic to wheat.	1085
3988	He's actually in here right now.	1083
3989	What would Cuddy have done?	1083
3990	I'm out of here on Friday.	1081
3991	It works out well for everyone.	1080
3992	She took a bet that she knew she'd win.	1080
3993	Whatever's gonna get him better.	1079
3994	Especially after years of following that much smaller third organ.	1078
3995	From a corporation that's going through a very public belt-tightening.	1076
3996	She knew better than anybody what a tool he could be.	1076
3997	Her mom hates me, so she can't visit, she ain't accepting my calls.	1076
3998	Question is, why did he want that?	1075
3999	I knew when he got out, I'd get my job back.	1074
4000	Nothing's wrong with having fun.	1074
4001	Assuming, of course, we are talking about House.	1071
4002	She's leading with her chin.	1070
4003	Root canal and Berger's.	1070
4004	It was like he forgave me.	1069
4005	But a shotgun is not gonna work.	1069
4006	Hey, hey, don't point that thing at me.	1069
4007	Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch.	1068
4008	Find out what else he's lying about.	1067
4009	And Chase being cagey in general.	1066
4010	I talked to Chase and Taub.	1066
4011	Just to get his money.	1065
4012	None of this is fun, House.	1064
4013	I'm gonna get through eventually.	1064
4014	Well, if I'm gonna die, I might as well do it with a clean soul.	1063
4015	What's wrong with him?	1062
4016	Chances are he's done it before.	1062
4017	That's everything bad that's happened.	1062
4018	Thinking in here! Brain scans indicate it could be Loa loa disease.	1062
4019	Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.	1061
4020	No muscle symptoms, and urine had no myoglobin.	1060
4021	We got him breathing, but barely.	1059
4022	And I've been a lousy mom.	1059
4023	Saving us both from contraband charges.	1056
4024	I think I'm gonna-- all right, I admit it.	1056
4025	Uh, it's nothing personal.	1055
4026	Maybe I'll understand.	1055
4027	Time to grow up and come clean.	1054
4028	What's that I smell, friiend?	1053
4029	Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.	1051
4030	Plus Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, that's 11 in all.	1050
4031	So he could die before he gets one.	1049
4032	It's probably nothing.	1048
4033	That normally happens every 30 days.	1048
4034	Means it's not Zollinger-Ellison.	1047
4035	Sickness and health, right?	1046
4036	Right upper quadrant, pain and distension.	1045
4037	Well, I guess I don't have a son anymore.	1045
4038	How could that possibly work as a tactic?	1045
4039	That people don't change.	1044
4040	But this mold definitely is.	1043
4041	We ruled that out three days ago.	1041
4042	Screen tested it yesterday and shot it today.	1041
4043	That seems like an overreaction.	1041
4044	Saline's flushing it forward but getting no return.	1040
4045	Never was raped, not raped-raped.	1040
4046	I'm not seeing any calcifications.	1040
4047	I'm totally fine with Taub or Park.	1039
4048	I won this off her prop master in a poker game.	1038
4049	He's not stuck with me.	1036
4050	That didn't come up last night?	1035
4051	Well, think of this as today's free clinic.	1035
4052	I've watched more of him disappear than I ever got to know.	1034
4053	We also have a course in how to talk to someone in an interview.	1033
4054	This doesn't change anything between us.	1033
4055	We probably shouldn't be turning up unannounced like this.	1033
4056	She thinks I'm a prostitute on her turf.	1033
4057	What round of chelation is this?	1033
4058	This could be all psychiatric.	1032
4059	He's lying, not just Taub.	1032
4060	I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.	1031
4061	My husband sank it when he cheated on me.	1028
4062	I can't live in that home.	1028
4063	I'm not gonna interfere.	1027
4064	That's why we're successful.	1027
4065	House pulled it out of nowhere.	1026
4066	That's real mature, House.	1025
4067	And if it doesn't start?	1025
4068	We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding.	1024
4069	It's been a family business for 120 years.	1023
4070	Which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony.	1023
4071	It was good enough for my dad.	1022
4072	What looks like kidney disease, but isn't?	1021
4073	Can only make better choices from here.	1021
4074	A little less duck sauce and a little more soy sauce.	1020
4075	She's not on any meds.	1020
4076	And he told me I should leave.	1020
4077	Turns out we caused that.	1020
4078	Which means he wasn't really hurt.	1019
4079	Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.	1019
4080	Is my snacking really relevant to this case?	1019
4081	An understandable mistake.	1019
4082	I need an intubation kit in here! What's going on?	1018
4083	I've got an internship that starts in three weeks.	1018
4084	Maybe it's not stupidity.	1017
4085	I know this is tough.	1016
4086	I shouldn't have lied about it.	1015
4087	Good news is, it's treatable with medication.	1014
4088	He ate a bag of peanuts, and peanut proteins would be.	1013
4089	She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own.	1013
4090	No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work.	1012
4091	House thinks avoiding patients allows him to stay as objective as possible.	1012
4092	Yes, but what's it called?	1011
4093	Because I didn'tive him time to do anything else.	1010
4094	Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict.	1007
4095	She can't feel her foot at all.	1007
4096	She's not going to die.	1007
4097	Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us.	1006
4098	This would totally suck.	1006
4099	Chi Park as a result of her actions on October 7th of this year.	1004
4100	I was at a job interview.	1004
4101	I'm gonna start him on ceftriaxone.	1002
4102	Yeah, I think I read that too.	1002
4103	And he seemed happy and he seemed normal.	1000
4104	My mom's Filipino, Dad's Korean, and my boss grabbed my behind.	1000
4105	Just wanted to make sure all three were inside.	999
4106	Hepatic encephalopathy explained why he passed out, why he couldn't move his limbs.	998
4107	That is six miles out of my way.	998
4108	I guess, I mean-- yes, technically, I was thinking.	996
4109	I'm trying to keep House out of prison.	996
4110	I don't believe that.	995
4111	Does anyone have a position on our patient's medical condition?	995
4112	EKG and troponins were equivocal.	995
4113	We looked at his heart yesterday, didn't see any structural abnormalities.	994
4114	Let's get out of here first.	993
4115	She's determined not to do it again.	993
4116	It just wouldn't be good for my health.	993
4117	Occlusion time 9:46 and 23 seconds.	991
4118	Thinks he had a heart attack but didn't.	990
4119	He was not doing cocaine.	990
4120	Blood work was negative for HIV.	988
4121	And a lot of people owe me wedding gifts.	986
4122	My patient needs this.	986
4123	And 3 times 2 times 2 is 12.	986
4124	It probably doesn't mean anything, but we want to make sure.	985
4125	Wait, is this like a bucket list thing?	985
4126	Which is sad and pertinent.	984
4127	Could his dad's melanoma be a factor here?	984
4128	Causes arrhythmia, tremor, and mental changes.	982
4129	Rollo followed me in and took it.	982
4130	What else don't I know?	981
4131	Micropsia, bleeding, tachycardia, and difficulty breathing.	981
4132	Shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.	979
4133	I'm waiting for some test results.	978
4134	I was thinking of something more.	977
4135	Although I'm curious about a general answer too.	977
4136	It lowers libido and causes erectile dysfunction.	976
4137	I still don't think it's neurological.	976
4138	I think it's his liver.	975
4139	This doesn't make any sense.	975
4140	That only takes a couple of hours.	974
4141	Okay, he comes, he thinks he's waiting for practice.	974
4142	Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and, yes, mental changes.	971
4143	Could explain why his symptoms appeared so rapidly.	970
4144	Why are we stealing cable from here?	970
4145	Belief implies a level of giving a crap that I am never gonna achieve.	970
4146	Just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating.	969
4147	What if she was misdiagnosed?	968
4148	If we keep her off, she'll be moody, but healthy.	968
4149	But daddy's boss is what we call a jackass.	967
4150	Okay, boys and girls.	967
4151	And rust means Arsenic.	967
4152	We don't even have a tv in our office.	966
4153	It went to interior designers, I understand.	965
4154	Why would he do that?	963
4155	This patient died five years ago.	963
4156	Different alters can have different apparent symptoms.	962
4157	He saved my husband's life.	961
4158	What about gifts from South America?	961
4159	Given his abnormal mental status, not necessarily.	961
4160	It means I've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.	960
4161	We should add language loss and aggression.	960
4162	I don't know what kind.	959
4163	This is gonna make me very happy.	959
4164	We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.	958
4165	Maybe he found out about her good friend.	958
4166	Is that how our system works?	957
4167	Or his liver's so far gone it can't even produce enzymes.	956
4168	House, get away from him.	955
4169	If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't.	953
4170	So best-case scenario, I've just had a glimpse into his future?	953
4171	This man's Ben's hero.	953
4172	It's not endocarditis.	952
4173	It's just a stupid way to make a living.	951
4174	IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies, he'll be fine.	950
4175	Okay, that's--y-- Yeah, yeah, yeah.	949
4176	It's not resolved, is it?	949
4177	If it's not a symptom, it's not relevant.	948
4178	Steve loved all that-- Sorry.	948
4179	Family-owned and operated.	948
4180	Doctors Adams and Park.	947
4181	No way Rollo'd diss me like that.	946
4182	I think his gist was.	946
4183	Was I dehydrated or not?	945
4184	And we're walking, we're walking.	945
4185	It's not worth living in fear.	945
4186	Cuddy's way didn't fail because she didn't try to control House.	945
4187	Mom, dad, and mom's dad.	944
4188	We still have no clue what's wrong.	944
4189	I'm not going to lose.	944
4190	I don't think she's lying.	943
4191	Get out! Where's Sykes?	943
4192	That doesn't make me a bad person.	943
4193	That falls under natural causes.	941
4194	New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.	940
4195	What does it matter if she says she's asexual?	939
4196	Let's get out of here.	939
4197	I don't know what it is.	939
4198	It's not an admission of guilt.	938
4199	I thought we'd gotten past that.	938
4200	It's not an infection.	937
4201	Cuddy had a problem with House, she came to me.	935
4202	Clinical signs can show up days before lab signs.	934
4203	I'm guessing it's a little of both.	934
4204	And men love commitment-free sex.	934
4205	It's not Lemierre's Syndrome.	933
4206	Joint pain, osteopenia, and anaphylaxis, eyebrow loss.	931
4207	It's not insider trading.	930
4208	No! Get out of here! Wait.	930
4209	I heard about a good new vegetarian place.	930
4210	I'm not being a dick.	930
4211	Excuse me, but only family members are allowed.	929
4212	Everywhere but a job interview.	927
4213	I'm only here to help.	925
4214	We should find out if she's been vaccinated.	924
4215	Donor six traveled to Thailand around Khorat.	924
4216	Bigger question is why that worked.	924
4217	He's fighting for his honor.	924
4218	That's completely normal.	923
4219	I hate it when people say that.	923
4220	She didn't complain about a headache.	922
4221	This bet's got to be a test.	922
4222	I think it's just dehydration.	922
4223	What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?	922
4224	Because I think I'm having a heart attack.	921
4225	Is this supposed to itch like this?	920
4226	I just said I don't feel anything.	920
4227	This will be our last round of questions.	919
4228	And mom's a selfish jerk.	919
4229	It's what my dad wants.	918
4230	Well, raped-raped, but not raped-raped-raped.	918
4231	Complete recruitment and interference pattern.	918
4232	I treated an inmate once with similar symptoms after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.	917
4233	It's uncomfortable, isn't it?	915
4234	Pregnancy, vaginal bleeding, and elevated B.	914
4235	Big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung.	914
4236	He's shedding his skin like a snake.	914
4237	Haven't heard an indirect order in here.	914
4238	Not with normal posterior column function.	912
4239	Feels like I'm missing something.	911
4240	Noradrenaline and near-death experiences.	911
4241	It's a family heirloom, which means old money.	909
4242	Take him off antiemetics, do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds.	909
4243	He's got his office back.	909
4244	Yeah, well, I don't have a son.	908
4245	We should make this a regular thing.	904
4246	She can barely catch her breath.	904
4247	Been working for House for two weeks.	904
4248	If only it would explain why we've never seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing.	902
4249	Misidentified as Martin Brodeur in a photo caption and box score.	899
4250	Steroids, PTU, and beta blockers.	898
4251	I'm not sloppy seconds.	898
4252	Not even at his funeral.	898
4253	Spoiled grandchildren.	897
4254	We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.	897
4255	I expect my people to lie better than that.	896
4256	I never went anywhere, did anything.	896
4257	I vowed I wouldn't let that happen to me.	895
4258	I've been considering applying to Doctors Without Borders.	895
4259	Will that still work?	894
4260	Still could have done permanent damage.	894
4261	Some people think it's burning now.	891
4262	It's Kawasaki's Disease.	891
4263	It looks absolutely nothing like frostbite.	891
4264	Cold fingers and toes?	891
4265	Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.	890
4266	She'd spend all her money on pills.	889
4267	She just needed some time.	888
4268	Maybe that's selfish.	886
4269	Oh, I'm not pregnant.	886
4270	Quarters came in handy.	886
4271	Yeah! It's called an acoustical shadow.	885
4272	I told House I thought it was a mistake.	885
4273	Have Chase start him on steroids.	885
4274	Find out what killed him.	882
4275	Transfusing his platelets will keep him healthy while we wait.	881
4276	Corticosteroids and IV immunoglobulin.	881
4277	She'll die without it.	880
4278	A little less guilty about seeing her.	879
4279	He can walk out of here cured.	878
4280	What else is she gonna think?	878
4281	Maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen.	878
4282	House S08E06 Parents By Mikhel for Subtitulos.	876
4283	Well, if he has normal pressure hydrocephalus, a tilt table test could put him in a coma.	874
4284	So I for sure got lung cancer?	874
4285	It's different for girls.	874
4286	Let's see if this helps.	873
4287	She doesn't even have a boyfriend.	872
4288	And Andrews is a hack.	871
4289	Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and.	871
4290	Interesting, but not relevant.	871
4291	want to just have fun?	871
4292	See, that would be an example.	870
4293	May I ask why that matters?	868
4294	She was in a car accident when she was two.	868
4295	I'm gonna need to see some tuna.	867
4296	I hadn't thought of that.	866
4297	I don't see any bleeding in here.	866
4298	I thought threatening him with jail would be different.	866
4299	Said he'd have his decision tomorrow.	866
4300	Chang and Eng Bunker.	866
4301	I do have an imaginary colleague who's just sent me an imaginary page.	865
4302	Antibiotics and IVIG.	865
4303	I-I think I want to get a job working as a circus clown, making people laugh.	864
4304	I'm scared of everything.	864
4305	How can he not be dead?	864
4306	It was close to here.	863
4307	People who just get off on weird cases.	862
4308	Drag Queens in Uganda.	861
4309	I'm still sending him back.	861
4310	Region was endemic with dengue fever.	861
4311	Well, what if it was?	861
4312	I'm in a dump with a guy almost twice my age.	859
4313	Joint pain is common, but not definitive.	859
4314	Pull! Sights seem to be off on this.	858
4315	I'm going with my girlfriend.	858
4316	That wouldn't be related.	858
4317	What about a year ago?	857
4318	After mom, I had nothing left.	854
4319	Pissing contest with Foreman.	854
4320	No, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.	853
4321	He's not hallucinating.	853
4322	Because it was so shallow.	852
4323	Trust me on this one.	852
4324	No, I meant, what was it?	851
4325	That's a very moving story.	849
4326	Something we think we know He did it.	848
4327	That could be fixable.	848
4328	I'm gonna let him be a donor.	847
4329	Root canal, if done correctly, doesn't look like kidney disease.	847
4330	Lots of people don't have sex.	846
4331	It's his risk to take.	846
4332	He's late for a trashcan fire.	846
4333	It's a little more than like.	845
4334	I'm gonna go give him P.	844
4335	Not as far as our lawyers are concerned.	844
4336	I just want to do everything I can to protect my family.	844
4337	I was angry, but I wasn't distracted.	844
4338	Definitionally, that involves.	843
4339	This is a good thing.	842
4340	Infection was right, after all.	842
4341	He wants to relive this.	841
4342	A hidden bunker with enough guns to defend Fort Knox.	838
4343	I think he's about to throw us out.	838
4344	That's my whiteboard.	837
4345	Can we talk about my patient?	837
4346	My mom will be happy to hear that.	837
4347	Goes to a homecoming party with his buddies, hops on his motorcycle, ends up an organ donor.	836
4348	If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden.	835
4349	It came out of nowhere.	835
4350	This woman seems perfectly healthy.	835
4351	Just not a great influence.	834
4352	Tomorrow morning, I am supposed to sign a piece of paper that will.	834
4353	That bloodwork is week's old.	832
4354	He also wants us to spy for him.	832
4355	I need to talk to mommy alone for a second.	832
4356	He's got his team back.	832
4357	His body wasn't disposing of iron.	831
4358	Renal failure, lung failure, heart failure, all before we started chemo.	830
4359	Yeah, I'll admit to that.	829
4360	But technically it will still pay off.	829
4361	Jobs are not being destroyed.	828
4362	Wilson said it wasn't cancer.	827
4363	Yeah, not one of my best people.	827
4364	Day care costs more than what I earned as a nurse.	827
4365	That's a mixed signal.	826
4366	I don't plan on being homeless forever.	826
4367	We don't call, she doesn't bolt.	826
4368	Looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.	825
4369	What about squamous cell carcinoma?	825
4370	I have an occasional beer with my friends.	824
4371	Or is it about something more profound?	824
4372	Internal neck trauma, that's impressive.	824
4373	He just opened his eyes a little while ago.	824
4374	I've only been in here one week.	824
4375	I still have my software company.	821
4376	Maybe we're just out of time.	821
4377	'Cause this expires today.	821
4378	What if it wasn't an accident?	819
4379	That blood looks pretty dry.	818
4380	His heart, liver, kidneys were all toast.	818
4381	Well, why would anyone try to poison our guy?	816
4382	His trachea wasn't swollen.	816
4383	On all of us Ah! Where do we go from here where do we go Dinner later?	815
4384	Probably got a kit stashed here.	815
4385	He's been incredibly well-behaved.	815
4386	With polyester uniforms?	814
4387	What about Fahr's disease?	814
4388	I was having sex at a motel when I started to feel light-headed.	812
4389	But it's related to medicine.	811
4390	That's my dark secret.	811
4391	I mean, not-- not really.	810
4392	I guess that would be me.	810
4393	My aunt had one just like it.	809
4394	What's wrong with my stomach?	809
4395	What about transverse myelitis?	808
4396	I know about exit taxes.	807
4397	I can't believe I have cancer.	807
4398	I mean, I hope to God I never have to use one.	804
4399	Just like sane people can be illogical.	804
4400	What, so I can get busted by Social Services?	803
4401	We don't have any choice.	802
4402	What about posttraumatic syringomyelia?	801
4403	I do this demonstration every year.	801
4404	I didn't say it was wrong.	801
4405	What about a stick of gum?	800
4406	I just don't like it.	800
4407	Couldn't have said it better myself.	799
4408	What about Whipple's?	798
4409	See what a tough spot I'm in?	797
4410	He wasn't trying to pull anybody away.	797
4411	I'm staining for excess iron.	797
4412	What about pheochromocytoma?	796
4413	It means we were wrong about lead.	796
4414	We needed to see if it was still a symptom.	795
4415	Not everything has an agenda.	794
4416	We wait 30 minutes, she'll definitely have brain damage.	794
4417	Can we get to my patient sometime soon?	793
4418	What about porphyria?	793
4419	Why would I be trying to make him look bad?	792
4420	It was just paranoid rage, typical of Alzheimer's.	791
4421	Well, I think we've heard enough.	790
4422	Just some irritation from lying in bed all day.	789
4423	It's getting hard to see.	789
4424	So we've got nothing.	787
4425	He caught me with her, got me with a rake.	787
4426	Unless he was still being poisoned.	786
4427	Especially in a house with locked medicine cabinets.	786
4428	That means low self-esteem.	785
4429	Like, not even a bottle of water?	785
4430	So whose urine is that?	785
4431	We do not provide child care.	782
4432	Shouldn't have said anything.	781
4433	He was sitting at his desk.	777
4434	buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.	776
4435	Can't treat for both.	776
4436	Should we also add forgetfulness?	775
4437	Well, maybe Adams was right.	773
4438	Not as much as House's surprise attacks.	773
4439	Once we establish rhythm, any accidental movement could crash him back into V-fib.	772
4440	This is completely my fault.	771
4441	So it's really over $100?	770
4442	'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.	769
4443	Foreman's gonna need a diagnostician.	769
4444	I don't think he can take it.	768
4445	I don't have a boyfriend.	767
4446	He's never gonna know.	766
4447	Great ideas, if dengue fever or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly.	766
4448	Hey! Is this supposed to happen?	765
4449	She's already got neurological symptoms.	765
4450	She got worse after being on steroids, so autoimmune is out.	764
4451	Now I'm trying to start my life over.	764
4452	I think it could be hyperviscosity syndrome.	764
4453	I was just a teenager.	764
4454	Agh! Oh, that is too bad.	764
4455	I don't have to cough as much.	763
4456	Not once I call Social Services.	761
4457	But-- Do what Park says.	761
4458	Took real good care of himself.	761
4459	That unexpected things happen.	761
4460	It's his lymph nodes.	760
4461	'Cause I'm firing her myself.	759
4462	I'm gonna need number three Vicryls.	759
4463	She doesn't have a Berry aneurysm.	759
4464	This is my only copy.	759
4465	His echocardiogram is negative for cardiomyopathy.	759
4466	Was it really worth it?	759
4467	Taking her off made it more apparent.	756
4468	Who obviously didn't take his vows.	755
4469	How does briefly wishing I was screwed up make me screwed up?	755
4470	She doesn't want to see him.	755
4471	She needs a transplant, but.	755
4472	So forget being sorry.	754
4473	She listens to me, I waste an hour.	754
4474	I almost died in that cell.	753
4475	This is our orientation.	752
4476	'Cause I'm hurting him.	752
4477	How can I be pregnant if I've never even had sex?	751
4478	Hey, hey, hey! I need backup here.	751
4479	Seems like someone's feeling better.	751
4480	Means we're wrong about infection.	751
4481	It's just a benign fat deposit.	750
4482	Just really love being a doctor so much.	750
4483	I tell her it's vitamin C.	749
4484	Test shows she's still pregnant.	748
4485	Or it's just rich guilt.	748
4486	Thanks for all my help.	747
4487	He's puking his guts out.	747
4488	Which means not family.	747
4489	Our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem.	745
4490	We need to talk about Saturday night.	744
4491	Let's finish this up.	744
4492	It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus.	743
4493	I want to make sure I can position her wrist properly.	743
4494	I'll never be able to explain, never tell her how sorry I am.	742
4495	What, getting knifed doesn't buy me an extension?	742
4496	It's really screwed up to romanticize it.	741
4497	House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass.	739
4498	No, this is me helping me.	738
4499	That'll teach me to overbill.	737
4500	I have to send him to prison.	737
4501	Building Buddhist temples for 50 generations.	736
4502	We didn't guess it because nobody gets it.	736
4503	He obviously noticed something.	736
4504	'Cause nothing's happened.	735
4505	So this isn't diabetes?	735
4506	Two rounds of 360 without establishing a rhythm.	735
4507	Who plays poker without cigars?	734
4508	Reilly's done far fewer dissections than I have.	733
4509	I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.	733
4510	All we do is take money from sick people.	733
4511	To avoid having this conversation.	733
4512	But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.	732
4513	I don't have a headache.	731
4514	He hasn't asked me for anything.	731
4515	It took my parents years to get over it.	731
4516	Some think it's quite a natural reaction.	730
4517	This isn't necessarily paranoia.	730
4518	Buys 24 hours to fix it, 12 of which have passed.	730
4519	Ethics are not my strong suit.	730
4520	I think I might have said insane.	729
4521	Next thing I knew, I was laying on my back.	728
4522	We don't have a choice.	727
4523	'Cause it's gonna end badly.	726
4524	We tried that already.	725
4525	Actually, it was my idea.	725
4526	Diabetic girlfriend without health insurance?	725
4527	No, he's not my boyfriend.	724
4528	This case is a fiasco.	723
4529	He's got everything he needs.	723
4530	She does have a boyfriend.	723
4531	I have a chance to really watch it.	722
4532	Wherever my chewing muscles are.	722
4533	I just need to see how far it goes.	722
4534	I th--I think I'm gonna go.	722
4535	Girl who doesn't want anything from a stranger is crazy.	721
4536	I might've missed that.	720
4537	I need her out of my life.	720
4538	Burned his lungs, which is why he coughed up blood.	720
4539	Not much of anything.	719
4540	I specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.	719
4541	He isn't gonna put himself back in jail over a dead kid.	718
4542	We still got to get it out.	718
4543	Get one in my cell after lights-out.	718
4544	We can't smoke in here.	718
4545	It's called tumor lysis syndrome.	717
4546	Because it's so strong even plain contradictions.	717
4547	Only with fewer bums with herpes.	716
4548	Straight as after that.	716
4549	So I really have no choice.	716
4550	But he makes us all better.	715
4551	I told House I couldn't come back until next week.	715
4552	I'm just playing solitaire.	715
4553	We tested him for syphilis.	714
4554	I'm feeling much better now.	714
4555	Because he was having headaches?	714
4556	I'm gonna need a continuance.	713
4557	It's like we're twins.	713
4558	I met a woman who likes her men well groomed.	712
4559	According to this article, at least.	711
4560	Ha ha ha! This is great.	711
4561	Start him on plasmapheresis.	710
4562	We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian children.	708
4563	Nothing wrong except a common bladder infection.	708
4564	All right, now go to work, House.	708
4565	Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life.	707
4566	Had a meeting about a new parking validation system.	706
4567	Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.	705
4568	It's actually pretty fun.	704
4569	Would have made my life a lot easier.	704
4570	Chances are his mental state will improve.	704
4571	Can't change what happened.	703
4572	If Adams is right, he'll spike a fever, get hypotensive, we can treat it.	702
4573	I need help with my patient.	701
4574	I'm only moving it to China because I'm craving egg foo yung.	701
4575	Angry at God or I just need a challenge?	701
4576	No, it was my idea! Seriously, House?	701
4577	Yeah, but even a broken doctor's right twice a day.	701
4578	This is an ultrasound machine.	701
4579	Got a patient with end stage renal disease.	700
4580	Drew wasn't deaf! House.	700
4581	He's doing his clinic hours.	699
4582	Or it's been chronic, which points to GAD autoimmunity.	698
4583	That is a sign of concern.	697
4584	Pop! Is that supposed to be funny?	695
4585	Couldn't find my keys for days.	695
4586	I don't think he's a psych case.	694
4587	Calming, but with a hint of nurturing.	694
4588	Swelling would have followed gravity.	693
4589	Know how I got interested in medicine?	693
4590	He's gone from ally to enemy.	693
4591	Which actually doesn't prove anything.	692
4592	I can't believe how stupid I've been.	690
4593	Or something she's wearing.	690
4594	This is a thyroid issue.	690
4595	I brought him in here under false pretenses.	690
4596	I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.	689
4597	I haven't done a jugular line since my residency.	689
4598	Don't usually see Darwinian changes over breakfast.	687
4599	So he was obviously afraid of something.	687
4600	I'm thinking occult long QT syndrome?	686
4601	Good things usually happen; bad things sometimes happen.	686
4602	My guilt over my mom is why I put up with my dad.	686
4603	I guess that sounded.	686
4604	Is that fugliness weekly?	685
4605	E.R. found nothing wrong.	685
4606	It's called syphilis.	683
4607	Would have seen meningial signs.	683
4608	Wait, we're gonna be here a while.	683
4609	Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter.	682
4610	Can even cause some unpredictable allergic reactions.	681
4611	I have a patient who's asexual.	680
4612	Get out of my House, Stomper.	680
4613	I'm still going to my pediatric one.	679
4614	I custom-built this puppy.	679
4615	This is Aaron Rodgers.	679
4616	He didn't have a rash.	678
4617	Treat her for alcoholism.	678
4618	really need a lot of money.	678
4619	He's not immuno-compromised.	677
4620	I'm working! How much?	676
4621	I have to get to my car.	676
4622	I think he actually has a good point.	674
4623	Not worth more than my honor.	673
4624	Probably just a really, really decent person.	672
4625	Nothing is ever over.	671
4626	I feel like I'm in hell.	671
4627	Or it's something else.	670
4628	How about a viral syndrome?	670
4629	I had to drop my kids off at day care across town.	668
4630	M-make me want to have sex?	667
4631	Reverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago.	667
4632	How's he gonna learn if we stop his act?	666
4633	Well, I'm glad we could be so accommodating.	666
4634	People with mental deficiency can be logical.	666
4635	It's been years since he died.	665
4636	Got a policy review meeting in here in five minutes.	662
4637	I'm still gonna-- Keep less?	662
4638	I could live on dialyses for years.	660
4639	I'm thinking of going hang gliding.	660
4640	Working on a medical case is not a parole violation.	660
4641	That is so fifth grade.	659
4642	We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound.	657
4643	I don't like owing people things.	657
4644	He can't function under someone's thumb.	657
4645	But a girl has needs.	655
4646	Cuddy threatened him with clinic duty.	655
4647	Pregnancy would explain all of her symptoms.	655
4648	We have a reasoned disagreement.	654
4649	We all have family dysfunction.	653
4650	Why'd I even have to?	653
4651	I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma.	652
4652	Antique locket-- it's unpolished gold.	652
4653	Her heart can't support dialysis.	651
4654	I got to--I got to get out.	651
4655	She's feeling much better.	650
4656	It's usually a sign of a skull fracture.	650
4657	I just take vitamin C sometimes.	650
4658	I can't take my finger out.	650
4659	I wouldn't worry about it.	649
4660	I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.	649
4661	I'm sure she succeeded.	648
4662	He's giving a kidney to someone he's never met?	647
4663	Four-year-olds do not die of Berger's.	647
4664	Doesn't explain why he vomited so hard he ripped his insides.	647
4665	Come on, just a little more time.	647
4666	Chase basically called me a sellout.	647
4667	He's had his eyebrows waxed.	644
4668	I have had second thoughts.	644
4669	Just give him five aspirin.	643
4670	Could have kidney involvement.	643
4671	Nowhere near enough vitamin A.	642
4672	I ain't got a girlfriend in here.	642
4673	So can I get back to work?	641
4674	Not by hiding myself away.	640
4675	It's like Satan's alarm clock.	640
4676	Let me start with an allegory.	640
4677	I'm going back to work.	639
4678	Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.	639
4679	I had a video interview with Chicago yesterday.	638
4680	He's getting rid of everything.	637
4681	Phase one of operation outer office 2.0.	637
4682	Poison wouldn't have to be in food.	635
4683	Why does he have a file?	635
4684	We can't take it personally.	635
4685	I left because of his eyes.	634
4686	We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal.	633
4687	His liver enzymes are slightly elevated.	633
4688	Back home, I keep a few for hunting 'roos.	633
4689	I think it's Whipple's disease.	631
4690	Yes, it was nice having my daughter in my home.	631
4691	So I'm gonna be completely cured.	631
4692	Sorry about yesterday.	630
4693	Well, I'm walking back.	630
4694	Outside of work, I still consider us all friends.	630
4695	I think it was eerily.	629
4696	Plaques could be confused for nodules.	627
4697	It's happened to me a few times.	627
4698	We still can't rule it out.	626
4699	House's complete lack of concern is evidence of his deep concern?	625
4700	We actually started calling her Sophie.	624
4701	He really went after her.	624
4702	But I didn't mean physical stress.	623
4703	Not some hipster thing.	623
4704	Which proves she's an idiot.	622
4705	She passed with flying colors.	621
4706	Thbathroom also tested positive for five different types of pathogenic bacteria.	621
4707	It's great to be back among friends.	620
4708	I don't know, um, he.	618
4709	Girlfriend might not be so bad.	618
4710	We're not having an affair.	618
4711	She's a PhD in toxicology, right?	617
4712	Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky.	617
4713	It's probably from my seat belt.	616
4714	I'm doing it to help my patient.	616
4715	He thought Taub's idea was stupid.	615
4716	She confirmed he's been feeling fine.	614
4717	I'm thinking brucella.	614
4718	Wants treatment for diabetes.	613
4719	Why is he so obsessed with my kids being my kids?	612
4720	Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter.	611
4721	Get out of my office, please.	611
4722	We've been separated for almost a year.	610
4723	He already said I was an ass.	609
4724	Maybe she has cancer.	608
4725	So we're back to square none?	608
4726	Dull people get cancer too.	608
4727	We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.	608
4728	I'm running PCR test now.	607
4729	No, I think it's sad.	607
4730	His leg muscles are fine.	607
4731	Which, in turn, makes his unrepentant attacker.	607
4732	Hereditary angioedema or systemic mastocytosis could mimic anaphylaxis.	607
4733	It should have been me.	606
4734	Who says I have baggage?	605
4735	We still have a long way to go.	605
4736	Easily we cry Now get out.	605
4737	His heart rate's finally elevating.	604
4738	we did what we could.	604
4739	It wasn't caused by a v-fib.	603
4740	It's none of my business.	602
4741	Go a little bit more along here.	602
4742	Not a fan of guns I take it.	602
4743	I'll keep looking here.	602
4744	Never afraid to show his emotions.	601
4745	But we wound up finding something.	601
4746	Will anyone believe Chase is an actual Doctor?	601
4747	I can think of easier ways to make 175 bucks a week.	600
4748	Just don't interrupt me.	599
4749	Nothing is tamper-proof.	598
4750	If it doesn't resolve itself, we'll have to repair it.	598
4751	She's perfectly fine-looking.	597
4752	Park's hearing's about to start.	597
4753	Call her family, her friends, her work.	597
4754	At least his white blood cells were special.	596
4755	Don't get too excited.	593
4756	It's our only choice.	592
4757	He said he was at work.	592
4758	We're testing for iron overload.	592
4759	Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.	591
4760	Not if he took aspirin.	590
4761	Again, given what I've seen at Bloomingdale's.	589
4762	She treated it like it never happened.	587
4763	It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm found in feces.	586
4764	certain carpet-cleaning chemicals have been linked to it.	585
4765	We caused it by giving him steroids when he first came in.	584
4766	It's at my stepdad's law office.	584
4767	It's already too long.	583
4768	I was stabbed by a patient.	582
4769	He doesn't have joint pain.	581
4770	my heart rate is not.	580
4771	Every time I see her, I say.	580
4772	Probably just got sick of lying.	579
4773	People who got something to prove.	578
4774	I have two little boys.	577
4775	No way not to mess it up.	577
4776	When I paid him a visit, he took off.	573
4777	Gives us about 20 minutes.	572
4778	It can also just be dehydration.	572
4779	Hey, we're having a conversation here.	572
4780	In Sunday's sports section, New Jersey Devils goaltender Johan Hedberg was.	570
4781	Class-four hemorrhoids, like him.	570
4782	Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.	570
4783	Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?	570
4784	Not an irrational thought.	570
4785	It was a three-plus 20 minutes ago.	569
4786	Even if he didn't light up himself.	569
4787	Get me her O-two level.	568
4788	We did a major operation for no reason.	567
4789	Because I found someone I love?	566
4790	Her feelings are based on a chemical process.	566
4791	But I hadn't had sex in years.	566
4792	I also have kind eyes.	565
4793	House longer than anyone.	565
4794	I'm never quite sure.	564
4795	It's a tale as old as time.	563
4796	He doesn't have photic epilepsy.	562
4797	Now I have swollen ankles.	562
4798	Oh, now I just want to win.	562
4799	Okay, look, I know who I am, okay?	561
4800	She's moved on-- new hub, new kid.	560
4801	Gallstones could've-- no complaints of pain.	560
4802	I'll look for toxins myself.	557
4803	We're out of time when we're out of time.	556
4804	Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?	556
4805	We just need a drop of blood.	555
4806	So maybe she's lying.	554
4807	Is everyone trying to think of an answer?	554
4808	It's going to be okay, baby.	554
4809	Dutch chocolate's not bad.	554
4810	She's overwhelmed enough.	554
4811	But he needed an excuse.	553
4812	It was my fault daddy died.	552
4813	It just isn't worth it, House.	552
4814	She's responding well.	552
4815	Get out alive on Friday.	551
4816	House left a bottle of Vicodin to see if she'd steal it.	551
4817	it's normal pressure hydrocephalus.	549
4818	She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.	549
4819	I'm gonna do a quick breast exam.	548
4820	Even if it was based on lies.	548
4821	'Cause it's an anxiety attack.	548
4822	It wasn't my boyfriend.	548
4823	Left-sided pain means it could be angina, which is made worse by stress.	548
4824	Talking about medicine.	547
4825	His heart should start soon.	546
4826	Get her into O.R. 11.	544
4827	We'll have lunch, okay?	543
4828	No, I wasn't being rhetorical.	543
4829	It's been mildly elevated.	543
4830	Anyone can screw up a life.	542
4831	House, House, just stop it.	542
4832	Did I have an epidural?	541
4833	Well, what's after respect?	541
4834	Now it feels like my whole body's on fire.	540
4835	No, I think I got palliative.	540
4836	What causes breathing issues, bleeding issues, paralysis, loss of consciousness?	538
4837	Guess what kind of animal Wacky Benny's making now?	537
4838	'Cause I have a gift.	537
4839	So he has two types of people inside of him.	537
4840	We discussed it right here.	536
4841	It got, like, over 75,000 hits already.	536
4842	I was an ass last week.	536
4843	He was an only child.	536
4844	Being homeless isn't a vacation for me.	535
4845	But reaction to meds could.	535
4846	Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.	534
4847	I thought it was relevant.	534
4848	Angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.	534
4849	Go! We need to operate right now, okay?	534
4850	Burn cream would drown him faster than water.	534
4851	Not a fungal infection.	533
4852	Dr.House! My daughter's care is my choice.	532
4853	Let me know how it goes.	530
4854	I thought it was lead.	528
4855	Death is a consequence, not a symptom.	527
4856	Let me worry about logistics.	527
4857	Which is basically why we missed it.	527
4858	Boredom is not transmissible.	526
4859	Stealing's all I know.	524
4860	I just needed to create a distraction, though.	524
4861	It wasn't exactly an explosion.	523
4862	But ability isn't always enough.	523
4863	No, I got everything in need.	523
4864	If it was GAD, he'd be having seizures.	522
4865	It was too an explosion.	521
4866	Fever's a little high, but it still fits.	520
4867	Imaginary medicine is not my specialty.	520
4868	Those flowers are from last week.	519
4869	'Cause I could knock her up.	519
4870	It was a perfect diagnostic moment.	518
4871	I can refuse to see any visitor I want.	518
4872	Please, um, it's okay.	517
4873	Just two more questions.	517
4874	Fine enough to get back to work?	517
4875	Here's a photograph of me holding a newspaper.	516
4876	He used to call him deezer.	516
4877	Just feels heavy when I do.	516
4878	It was my fault daddy's-- Oh, no.	516
4879	Won't her chest pain come back?	515
4880	It wasn't a miscarriage.	515
4881	I think House is right.	514
4882	Also known as multiple personality disorder.	514
4883	Is everything all right?	513
4884	Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off.	512
4885	Syph test was negative.	512
4886	CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.	512
4887	Funduscopic exam was normal.	511
4888	He asked for a personal day.	511
4889	No, paralysis was first.	511
4890	I was sick of living a lie.	511
4891	Patient's having an allergic reaction to donor platelets.	511
4892	I have to find a place to live.	510
4893	I wasn't at a funeral.	510
4894	It was a moment of weakness.	509
4895	Yes, we knew what kawah meant.	509
4896	Commitment's not conditional.	508
4897	It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.	508
4898	I hitchhiked to Manhattan, moved in with an older guy.	508
4899	We should continue plasmapheresis.	506
4900	We'll know in a few hours.	506
4901	I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers.	506
4902	Her blood pressure's been elevated.	505
4903	Should have clarified.	505
4904	His paranoia started at least a year ago.	505
4905	I mean, he's constantly reminded of her.	504
4906	It's a tough thing to control.	503
4907	I've got only two years left in my stretch.	502
4908	It doesn't seem like much of a case.	501
4909	Get him an echo to confirm.	501
4910	Patient's heart valves are normal.	501
4911	For example, our opinions on mental illness.	500
4912	Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm.	500
4913	We can do a partial liver transplant from a living donor.	499
4914	With great power comes great micromanaging.	499
4915	When he inhaled small amounts of smoke, he had small problems.	499
4916	I'm a little confused.	499
4917	Diazepam was masking it.	498
4918	It could destroy his identity.	498
4919	He came here last night.	498
4920	No, we already tested his liver enzymes.	497
4921	It was a little harsh.	496
4922	She can see perfectly.	496
4923	We shouldn't be here.	496
4924	Happily married for ten years.	494
4925	Aagh! He--he had on a what?	494
4926	It was blocked by a pseudomembrane growing across it.	493
4927	She's writing my opening statement.	493
4928	It was a team-building exercise.	492
4929	My option to sell Barton Foods at $34 is about to expire.	492
4930	It's normal to be screwed up.	491
4931	Not a Pheochromocytoma.	491
4932	giving something to relax her.	491
4933	Sex can wane in any marriage over time.	490
4934	All parents screw up all children.	489
4935	From what I remember.	489
4936	What day did Jesus die?	488
4937	A faint one, on his cheek.	488
4938	It means he's got a tumor.	488
4939	It was nobody's fault.	487
4940	I don't remember anything.	487
4941	Certain drugs could explain her reaction.	487
4942	Must be bleeding into his lungs.	486
4943	Patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year.	486
4944	It's a brain problem.	486
4945	Losing a child-- just breezed right through it.	485
4946	'Cause I can't feel my legs.	484
4947	It was a pretty tough conversation.	484
4948	I only help those who can help myself.	483
4949	She's lying to compensate.	483
4950	But family comes first.	483
4951	Anita, she's fun, smart.	483
4952	I have polycystic kidney disease.	483
4953	I'm seeing a trauma counselor.	483
4954	Get him adenosine, stat.	482
4955	It's linked to type A personalities.	482
4956	Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.	481
4957	I'm enjoying our conversation.	481
4958	She couldn't keep a job.	481
4959	It was coagulated plasma.	481
4960	Abdominal ultrasound was negative.	480
4961	It's a slow-growing tumor.	480
4962	It's a conclusive test.	480
4963	When he encouraged Ben to drop out of school?	479
4964	It was a rainy night.	479
4965	Turns out I like boring.	478
4966	Start treatment with steroids.	478
4967	It's no longer my choice.	478
4968	Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives.	478
4969	Emory was a wonderful man.	477
4970	Probably started growing in his early teens.	476
4971	Like he loves our kids more.	476
4972	He'd have localized pain.	476
4973	But I've given up red meat.	475
4974	Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.	475
4975	It's probably aseptic meningitis.	475
4976	I have a department to re-fund.	475
4977	Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?	475
4978	Oh, whatever it takes.	474
4979	It started with card games.	473
4980	It's 10:15 on Friday.	473
4981	It's my job description.	472
4982	In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's patients regress to old routines.	472
4983	It was a harmless prank.	471
4984	Tox screen was clean.	471
4985	No, I don't need a minute.	471
4986	Everything has gone blue.	471
4987	We also probably ruined his life.	471
4988	So much for genetics mattering.	470
4989	I was expecting a battery of lawyers.	469
4990	We've just been assuming.	469
4991	I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.	468
4992	Why would I need a gun?	468
4993	We're running out of time.	468
4994	I don't think so, no.	468
4995	Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst.	468
4996	I'm still on temporary vows.	465
4997	What if he has a heightened immune system?	465
4998	More deserving than anyone else?	464
4999	I saved her from brain damage.	464
5000	S.T.D. panel was negative.	464
5001	After he lost his son, he lost his job.	464
5002	Looks like we're both wrong.	463
5003	Start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.	462
5004	I have a massive migraine.	462
5005	100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.	462
5006	Was he sensitive to sunlight?	461
5007	It's a medical diagnosis.	461
5008	It was a 50/50 choice.	461
5009	Bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus.	460
5010	I'm Walter Cofield, Chief of Neurology, Mercy Hospital.	459
5011	Hormone levels are normal.	458
5012	It's a valid sexual orientation.	458
5013	I don't need an A.B.G.	456
5014	More risk, but more upside.	455
5015	If he has myelodysplastic syndrome, he'll bleed out.	455
5016	It was aerosolized Heparin.	455
5017	At least I have principles.	454
5018	Those who can't teach, teach gym.	454
5019	when his seizure occurred.	453
5020	According to my calendar, I'm a week early.	453
5021	Those who can't, teach.	452
5022	It's Reye's syndrome.	452
5023	It's an imperfect world.	452
5024	It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.	452
5025	He's having an allergic reaction.	451
5026	Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.	450
5027	House! Mendelson! He's on 80 mg of Propranolol.	449
5028	He has stridor but no obstruction.	447
5029	It's a medical procedure.	447
5030	If it saves a life, who cares?	447
5031	I'm being professional.	446
5032	Can it cause hallucinations?	445
5033	We're consulting with Neurology.	445
5034	I have staff searching.	445
5035	Ray! Leave him alone.	444
5036	Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills.	444
5037	With some difficulty.	443
5038	It sort of does for me.	443
5039	Maybe if everybody didn't lie.	443
5040	House isn't gonna give up.	442
5041	He's watching tv d drinking martinis all night.	442
5042	It's a major surgery.	442
5043	He has no schistocytes in his smear.	442
5044	Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.	441
5045	I got one final confession to make.	440
5046	I'm guessing ankle monitor.	439
5047	Hey, look, we'll adjust.	439
5048	I've been second-guessing myself all day.	438
5049	It's tissue inflammation.	437
5050	When I saw her waiting.	437
5051	Well, don't look at me.	436
5052	He has a nodule in his thyroid.	436
5053	Some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.	435
5054	He's moving it out of grief.	433
5055	What's happening to me?	433
5056	I'm a talented physician, top 2% of my class.	431
5057	One dead lobe means four alive ones.	431
5058	Prep a room for an embolectomy.	431
5059	It's a press release.	430
5060	Most good doctors are weird.	428
5061	It'll just take a minute.	428
5062	Kid needs a bone marrow transplant.	427
5063	I could save four or five more lives.	427
5064	He's allergic to a person?	427
5065	It's a pleural effusion.	425
5066	I wanted to see how deep it went.	425
5067	My mom, she died four months ago.	424
5068	Mr.Chips looks like he wants it.	423
5069	With no local symptoms?	422
5070	He trained for a marathon once.	422
5071	Arrhythmias are gone.	421
5072	Just a sore throat a few weeks ago.	421
5073	I'm protecting my diagnosis.	421
5074	Absolutely essential information.	420
5075	Highly insensitive for sarcoid.	418
5076	I know it feels strange.	418
5077	He's got no reason to lie to me.	417
5078	She died a few hours ago.	417
5079	I need a few minutes to think.	416
5080	BP just went to 140 over 90.	415
5081	Plenty of time to make money.	413
5082	For it to affect a pool of plasma.	413
5083	I got sciatica, like my dad.	412
5084	Good things usually happen.	409
5085	But we're on a clock.	409
5086	Nah, I'm a black, gay gypsy.	408
5087	Chase didn't listen to me.	408
5088	Wouldn't cause hallucinations.	407
5089	Tracin' faces I'm craving nachos.	406
5090	Everyone loves fireworks.	406
5091	By Mikhel for: Subtitulos.	405
5092	Fits his physical symptoms.	405
5093	Taub, Chase, Thirteen all moved on.	405
5094	Forging prescriptions?	403
5095	By Mikhel for Subtitulos.	403
5096	We'll take care of Nick.	402
5097	I-I think House set me up.	402
5098	Disseminated viral infection with encephalitis.	401
5099	Hoping everything else will come later.	401
5100	Any sign of weakness, 20 guys would line up to stick a sharpened-up toothbrush in my eye.	401
5101	Pregnancy test only infers an embryo's existence because of elevated HCG levels.	400
5102	Got some new girly mags too.	400
5103	makeup, perfume, birth control method, her Hello Kitty doll.	399
5104	Obviously he knows a lot of cops.	397
5105	I got something to do.	395
5106	Name should've been a giveaway.	392
5107	I mean, what am I supposed to do?	390
5108	All right, fine, clever.	390
5109	I felt God's love, his grace.	389
5110	Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities.	388
5111	We didn't find any poisons.	388
5112	Also, I don't own a suit.	388
5113	I mentioned it because.	387
5114	How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?	387
5115	100 bucks says I won't get fired.	386
5116	I didn't want a big, emotional scene.	385
5117	Could be a latex allergy.	385
5118	I can't feel my arms.	385
5119	I can't feel my legs.	384
5120	I came to speak with Dr.	384
5121	He's allergic to chlorine?	383
5122	I don't take charity.	383
5123	Right, better my mom should use me as a punching bag.	382
5124	He's allergic to summer lilac.	382
5125	Donor's an 18-year-old college kid back from Hosftra.	381
5126	I think I need a bigger dose.	381
5127	Our patient doesn't own a gun.	380
5128	Pressors will only give us a couple hours, Max.	380
5129	How can he be hyper-sexual?	379
5130	Doesn't change how I make an incision.	379
5131	I'll X-ray him on Friday.	378
5132	We disproved his asexuality.	378
5133	She never even cried.	377
5134	Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.	377
5135	Advanced enough, but no IV feedings.	376
5136	Most likely meds will be enough.	376
5137	Bad things sometimes happen.	375
5138	more than one person.	374
5139	No realization whatsoever.	371
5140	Bunch of his high school buddies.	371
5141	I'll start him on hematin.	371
5142	She doesn't wanna talk to me.	370
5143	I don't see creed, color, pulse.	370
5144	Iris hasn't had any severe traumas.	369
5145	His assistant's name is Angie.	369
5146	Iris has always been a moody girl.	368
5147	Jiminy didn't chirp much last night.	367
5148	I said don't interrupt.	367
5149	Her home number is-- Normal complement studies.	367
5150	He's got Alzheimer's.	366
5151	Bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.	366
5152	We married six months after I met him.	365
5153	Don't come in tomorrow.	364
5154	Denise never wants to see me again.	364
5155	Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena.	363
5156	Now we're back to boring reality reality.	363
5157	She has a job interview.	363
5158	Better go do some of those clinic hours I recently doubled.	363
5159	Everything looks good.	363
5160	He's got pictures of us.	360
5161	No contact, whatsoever.	360
5162	Start him on blood thinners.	360
5163	Hey, don't be an ass.	357
5164	Having a family doesn't exempt me from social responsibility.	356
5165	Can't be, bilirubin's normal.	356
5166	He's as ready as he's gonna be.	355
5167	Ruby dropped her off.	353
5168	Based on his yellow fingers.	351
5169	Bob, one of my shoes is missing from my locker.	350
5170	Everybody makes mistakes.	349
5171	No, he hasn't had anxiety or any trouble sleeping.	349
5172	I just wanna be happy.	349
5173	It sounds silly, but.	349
5174	I need to be taken into protective custody.	348
5175	Or an anaphylactoid reaction, which could be triggered by certain opioids.	348
5176	I can't move my arm or leg.	347
5177	His body temperature is rising.	347
5178	Something will turn up soon.	347
5179	His mental status is declining.	346
5180	I think we should run a pregnancy test.	346
5181	Could be transient nitrogen load from a G.I. bleed.	345
5182	To keep me from lying to patients?	345
5183	Sounds like a good plan.	344
5184	More like 13 minutes.	344
5185	Things are different.	343
5186	Uh, I'll-- I'll be outside.	343
5187	Just making an observation.	343
5188	Saving one life is good.	342
5189	Still does a few orders from home.	342
5190	I'll buy options instead of shares.	341
5191	Did I nick something?	341
5192	I figure I could live off $25,000 a year.	341
5193	He thinks three steps ahead, so I do too.	340
5194	Ventricles are clear too.	339
5195	escalate things somehow.	339
5196	Just ask Yngwie Malmsteen.	339
5197	Pain would be restricted to one dermatome.	338
5198	At least he thinks he did.	338
5199	No history of asthma.	338
5200	I'll get it at a clinic.	337
5201	I guess my minimum is just.	335
5202	Cameras are ringside too.	335
5203	Clotting parameters are normal.	334
5204	'Cause he couldn't hear properly.	334
5205	Blood work shows high levels of prolactin.	332
5206	I always wanted to believe.	332
5207	We are veering wildly off track.	329
5208	Please don't fire me.	329
5209	Works at an American factory.	329
5210	As long as I keep bringing her muffins.	328
5211	I ran away from home.	327
5212	Patient has low platelets.	327
5213	I didn't say I changed.	326
5214	Picks up her new kid at 4:15.	326
5215	Oh, everything has changed.	326
5216	Give him an E.E.G. to confirm.	325
5217	Paint fumes didn't cause contamination.	325
5218	I denied his request.	323
5219	His sclera's jaundiced.	323
5220	Ah, mm, yeah, actually.	323
5221	Start him on extracorporeal circulation.	322
5222	I suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by childhood abuse.	322
5223	We still get to do crazy crap?	322
5224	Things got a little heated.	320
5225	We're discharging him.	320
5226	Somebody call an ambulance! 	320
5227	Paraneoplastic syndrome's out.	320
5228	Didn't sleep last night.	320
5229	Patient got tachycardic to 185.	319
5230	Yes, Jarisch-herxheimer is real.	319
5231	I wouldn't mind a couple more details.	319
5232	We didn't do a lot of talking.	318
5233	Ran a complete physical on her.	317
5234	I had a whole life planned.	316
5235	Any type of birth control can fail.	315
5236	Second half of my plan might need work.	315
5237	Systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.	315
5238	People are complicated.	315
5239	Two days, one surgery.	314
5240	He'll ruin my career.	314
5241	We can start as soon as next week.	313
5242	I'll run some blood tests.	312
5243	She has jaw claudication.	310
5244	Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.	309
5245	Makes me think D.I.C.	306
5246	Acute onset points to tularemia.	305
5247	Chase certainly doesn't try to hide it.	305
5248	I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.	304
5249	It can hit any organ.	304
5250	I'll pick something up.	304
5251	I made it look like suicide.	304
5252	put him on antiemetics.	303
5253	Freak out is a little strong.	301
5254	Course-corrected two peoples' wildly screwed-up world views.	301
5255	I had eight months added to my sentence two months ago.	300
5256	We've brought people's kids back.	300
5257	Start him on antivirals.	300
5258	Start her on pressors.	299
5259	I visit her grave once a week.	298
5260	It doesn't make any sense.	298
5261	She asked me to come.	298
5262	It--it doesn't even make sense.	298
5263	Ortho needed more space.	297
5264	Start him on radiation.	296
5265	Is an ultrasound really necessary?	296
5266	So a guy gives everything Sane.	296
5267	Start him on Interferon.	296
5268	some things come into focus.	296
5269	My patient has a new symptom.	296
5270	Everything's shutting down.	295
5271	Patient probably has long QT.	295
5272	I've heard he's a wiggler.	294
5273	A little out of bounds?	294
5274	I've already got a religion.	293
5275	As long as we find something.	293
5276	He's in togood of shape.	293
5277	Because he said he apologized?	293
5278	Drink it, don't drink it.	292
5279	Her D-dimer's normal.	292
5280	We've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe.	292
5281	Aren't surfing enough.	291
5282	Saying no will cause both of us pain.	290
5283	Which means he goes home.	290
5284	He has one pair of pants.	290
5285	He makes a living sending people to prison.	290
5286	He won't even need surgery.	287
5287	Yes, as a parent, I empathize.	287
5288	Please stop calling me.	287
5289	Hey, how's my dad doing?	286
5290	Pax River is, like, completely flat.	285
5291	Patient had an idiopathic anaphylactic reaction.	285
5292	Negative chest X-rays aren't.	285
5293	We're gonna try again.	284
5294	Mom's hiding something.	283
5295	Blood chemistry showed high ammonia.	282
5296	Uh, like five months ago.	281
5297	We need to take a biopsy.	280
5298	I think he said exoplanets.	279
5299	He's having trouble holding a pencil in school.	279
5300	Switching rooms can be very disorienting.	277
5301	Sounds like drowning.	276
5302	Got to move it, people.	276
5303	Work in some boring office?	276
5304	Who am I talking to now?	274
5305	Three times two equals six.	274
5306	Sure, I'll feel guilty, start doubting.	274
5307	I've been gaining more weight.	272
5308	Nurse Williams to social services.	272
5309	When did Cuddy leave?	270
5310	doesn't take a boyfriend.	270
5311	She finishes work at 4:00.	269
5312	Temporal lobes are clear.	268
5313	Feel free to jump in at any time.	268
5314	He collapsed while out jogging.	268
5315	Maybe he got bit by a spider.	267
5316	He couldn't find a babysitter.	267
5317	Iris isn't sexually active.	267
5318	I could do a clotting test.	266
5319	Doctors can be degenerates.	266
5320	I had a closed session hearing last week.	266
5321	Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.	266
5322	Like an ironic thing?	266
5323	17-ketosteroid levels are low.	265
5324	House prefers chaos over cohesion.	264
5325	I gave those away too.	264
5326	Hasn't even broken as much as a traffic law.	264
5327	We got a guy in an ambulance heading to Princeton General.	263
5328	Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once.	263
5329	Stay out of my business.	263
5330	Fall in love, wanna be happy.	263
5331	We called 'em Drewisms.	263
5332	More dangerous than complete renal failure?	262
5333	A couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.	261
5334	So do I wish mom had used a gun instead of a bottle?	259
5335	pumped him full of it.	257
5336	Maybe we should look again.	254
5337	He couldn't say zebra.	253
5338	We got an order to reduce overcrowding.	253
5339	Girl says, yeah, me too.	252
5340	Fresh fruit in prison is usually chicken.	251
5341	Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage-- dehydration.	250
5342	House's process is dangerous, inappropriate.	250
5343	House used to be a doctor.	250
5344	House is also a fiasco.	250
5345	Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.	249
5346	Get O.R. Ten unpacked.	247
5347	Again, why does it matter?	247
5348	I even did a complete MRI.	247
5349	Kind of like Stockholm syndrome.	247
5350	Give me Chase, Taub, Thirteen.	246
5351	Code Grey! Get haloperidol.	246
5352	Unlimited Internet porn budget.	245
5353	I've paged a team of our best doctors.	245
5354	We've got brain activity.	244
5355	Mom died after a few years.	240
5356	He never had melanoma.	240
5357	I've been eating wheat my entire life.	240
5358	He always has a plan.	239
5359	Speaks to a certain callousness on Dr.	239
5360	My old man got diabetes at 50.	239
5361	Do anything different lately?	238
5362	Right up until it made me lose my daughter.	238
5363	Pull! She responding to corticosteroids?	237
5364	Masto's usually a skin disease.	237
5365	We only help rich white guys?	236
5366	Get me sutures on a Kelly.	236
5367	Head CT showed no signs of stroke or hemorrhage.	235
5368	Would it make a difference?	234
5369	Assuming I got lost, twice.	234
5370	He always seemed so nice.	233
5371	Patient complained of a sore throat a few weeks ago.	233
5372	Schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.	233
5373	He may die from those wounds.	232
5374	My leg is no good at judging time.	232
5375	An insignificant token.	230
5376	Worst case, could be an ectopic pregnancy.	230
5377	We can do a lumbar puncture to confirm.	229
5378	Gonna hurt, isn't it?	229
5379	An allergic reaction.	228
5380	He needs a transplant.	228
5381	He's having a seizure.	227
5382	No one's ever proved it exists.	226
5383	No broken bones, no signs of trauma.	225
5384	I wouldn't believe it.	224
5385	House is obviously brilliant.	221
5386	Could be a sign of cerebral infection.	220
5387	Why is it still rising?	220
5388	I like my nurses naughty.	220
5389	HIV-related mononeuritis multiplex.	218
5390	He's obviously paranoid.	218
5391	He had a bleeding problem earlier.	217
5392	I think I may throw up.	217
5393	At least it wouldn't be so annoying to watch.	216
5394	Any reason I shouldn't?	215
5395	Middle ear looks completely normal.	214
5396	My money's on rhabdomyosarcoma.	213
5397	It makes me work harder.	213
5398	Lungs, rash, now excessive R-R variability.	212
5399	Being a live donor has risks.	212
5400	Is she a giant pool of algae?	212
5401	Easier to pack in small crates.	211
5402	James Wilson, county coroner.	211
5403	Congratulations, Dr.House.	210
5404	Imagine how sorry I am.	209
5405	Hey, Emory, should we, uh, powder our noses?	209
5406	Test came back positive.	209
5407	Societies do fall apart.	208
5408	Wife used to run a floral company.	208
5409	We need to hit it harder.	207
5410	We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine.	207
5411	It could be a bladder infection.	206
5412	Liver function has improved 30%.	205
5413	He's--he's repeating, blue shack.	205
5414	Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?	204
5415	Look, he made a mistake.	203
5416	I am a cripple in need of assistance.	203
5417	As opposed to being right?	203
5418	Hey, we both assaulted our bosses.	203
5419	I never meant to hurt my daughter.	202
5420	He's enlightening us.	202
5421	One shot, one birdie.	202
5422	Patient's visited China a lot recently.	200
5423	It'd take a half hour to set up.	200
5424	In two months, I came running home.	200
5425	He's annoying, he's maddening.	199
5426	Must be some mistake.	199
5427	I remember everything.	198
5428	Even has a metaphor in it.	196
5429	Could be Zollinger-Ellison.	196
5430	Four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.	195
5431	Look, my girl's more important.	195
5432	Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.	195
5433	First patriotism, now loyalty.	194
5434	He's a bit of a sleaze.	194
5435	make a counter offer.	194
5436	Would it hurt to do both?	194
5437	We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg.	193
5438	Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.	191
5439	Which brings me to my most relevant question.	191
5440	Magazines go away so I won't ignore my children.	191
5441	Airway resistance down.	190
5442	Could be thyrotoxic paralysis.	190
5443	Heart rate's 140, pressure's dropping.	190
5444	no one's unhappy in Greece.	189
5445	We're over five minutes.	189
5446	He has high-frequency hearing impairment.	189
5447	He wanted to check on me.	188
5448	We need to ultrasound.	188
5449	He also has a low red count.	188
5450	I ain't got no stereo.	187
5451	Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice.	187
5452	I would love to be able to do it.	186
5453	He had a brain tumor.	186
5454	Won't even trust a co-worker.	186
5455	Need a lift tomorrow?	185
5456	In fact, I even encourage it.	185
5457	He's in a crypt at St.	185
5458	I went through a rebellious phase.	184
5459	Multiple birds, single stone.	184
5460	It wouldn't be a gift.	182
5461	He also spiked a fever overnight.	182
5462	Right middle lobe isn't.	180
5463	From Dorothy Dietrich's magic act.	179
5464	Could be Coxsackie B virus.	178
5465	Could be hyperalimentation.	178
5466	Patient's a smart businessman.	176
5467	It happened so fast, I did--I-- I.	176
5468	We need racemic epinephrine.	176
5469	We--went bankrupt five years ago.	176
5470	Heart rate's only 90.	176
5471	Circle of Willis also clear.	174
5472	Anti-anxiety medications would explain it.	174
5473	It produces excess hormone.	174
5474	We need a sniper rifle.	174
5475	Mom drank, dad worked.	173
5476	Could be polyarteritis nodosa.	173
5477	Could be pre-eclampsia.	173
5478	Hair samples were clean.	172
5479	Everybody looked up to me.	172
5480	300 milligrams amiodarone.	171
5481	Plays to my strengths anyway.	168
5482	Yes, completely unacceptable.	168
5483	Coma had to be a lucky guess.	166
5484	At least I wish I would.	166
5485	Who used to babysit Drew?	164
5486	Saving two is better.	164
5487	Which provides a nice contrast.	163
5488	must be scary to be back.	163
5489	He'll be able to go home in a few days.	163
5490	He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis.	163
5491	Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.	160
5492	We're missing symptoms.	160
5493	Will he miss a lot of school?	159
5494	A hot tub would be cool.	156
5495	coronary arteries were clean.	156
5496	Most jobs require at least basic word processing skills.	155
5497	Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals.	154
5498	Reduced clinic hours.	154
5499	Almost dying's been clarifying.	154
5500	So I made a terrible mistake.	154
5501	New office furniture.	154
5502	Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.	153
5503	He walked right up to me.	152
5504	Scam extra Vicodin, back to jail.	152
5505	Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.	150
5506	Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.	148
5507	My, uh, my back hurts.	145
5508	Maybe it won't be so bad.	144
5509	I would strongly advise.	144
5510	Both seems excessive.	142
5511	Iris has dissociative identity disorder.	142
5512	My patient signed a DNR.	142
5513	Fever came on too fast.	141
5514	Being normal is very important to Iris.	140
5515	My diagnostic test worked.	140
5516	On short time, tax goes up.	139
5517	Is he going to be okay?	139
5518	Myelodysplastic syndrome.	138
5519	Biopsy revealed, white blood cell inflitrate.	137
5520	Found it in my office.	136
5521	Wow, 127 quarterback rating.	136
5522	We took a cooking class.	135
5523	My team is made up of Type-A personalities.	134
5524	Yeah, I use booze as payment.	133
5525	A stupid, horrible mistake.	132
5526	Cassock made my ass look fat.	130
5527	He started vomiting again.	130
5528	When I ate strawberries.	130
5529	He has Plummer's disease.	130
5530	It makes a difference.	129
5531	Use cross-matched platelets.	129
5532	Same thing happened to me.	129
5533	Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?	129
5534	I should be on six a day.	128
5535	Orange means Mercury.	127
5536	Family members only during procedures.	126

5538	Saline flow is down to 10 ccs.	125
5539	Stevens-Johnson syndrome.	123
5540	I'd say giant cell arteritis.	122
5541	He lives in pennsauken under a different name, Mitchell Gordon.	121

5545	Lead exposure's a nice diagnosis.	118
5546	Racing heart: Medical condition.	117
5547	14-year-old girl, intermittent attacks.	117
5548	Let's go through it point by point.	117
5549	Emergency page takes precedence.	115
5550	He has to be professional.	115
5551	Capillary refill's good.	114
5552	Start an I.V. Come on.	114
5553	Drop it off in my cell.	113
5554	It looks very complicated.	112
5555	Meatloaf, potatoes, coffee.	111
5556	He'll wake up in an hour.	111
5557	We'll run a pregnancy test.	111
5558	Chips 5 bucks to take a dive.	107
5559	First cousin's also a whiff.	107
5560	I thought it'd be different.	104
5561	Is endocarditis treatable?	103
5562	Any recent health issues?	103
5563	Frankly, I feel violated.	103
5564	Reminded me of our St.	98
5565	Instead, I am going to lose $20,000.	97
5566	Maybe thrombocytopenia.	96
5567	O.M.F.G. 50% off cupcakes.	94
5568	Perfectly reasonable explanation.	94
5569	My, uh, my eye feels weird.	94
5570	Kids might be precocious.	94
5571	Hey! Hey! Son of a bitch.	92
5572	Points again to paranoia.	89

5574	He played awesome as usual.	88

5579	Knight to King's Bishop three.	83
5580	Case is under control.	82
5581	Low white count suggests infection.	81
5582	Won't be fast enough.	81
5583	I'd prefer to be paid in a single $100 bill.	80
