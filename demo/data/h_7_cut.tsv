1	as long as you're both paying attention, and are both good enough to work here.	59
2	this is a good thing.	59
3	good news is, it's treatable with medication.	59
4	good afternoon, cedarville! it is my distinct honor to present our annual community service award to one of our most outstanding citizens.	59
5	good thing you made it all official.	59
6	it's good to see you in the hospital, as a patient if not as a doctor.	59
7	right now's not a good time, house.	59
8	goes to school and makes good grades.	59
9	oh, my goodness, it is! hi, dean foreman! are you not gonna introduce us because we're married?	59
10	my leg is no good at judging time.	59
11	good for you! you loon.	59
12	at least as good as the other 12 times that i've called and paged you in the last three weeks.	59
13	it's a good bet that it's medically relevant.	59
14	but that'll destroy the good lung too.	59
15	it's not looking good for fahr's either.	59
16	you're about to withdraw from the world for good.	59
17	you take very good care of him.	59
18	good to see you on your feet.	59
19	well, i guess that's good enough for prison work.	59
20	it's for his own good.	59
21	good things usually happen; bad things sometimes happen.	59
22	i heard about a good new vegetarian place.	59
23	looks like we got ourselves a good, ol'-fashioned cat fight.	59
24	the good news is, made me realize that you were right.	59
25	we just need to get a good look at the rash.	59
26	it just wouldn't be good for my health.	59
27	you shouldn't run from what can still be a good life.	59
28	good things usually happen.	59
29	it's a good thing that worked.	59
30	it's just good to hear your voice.	59
31	i think he actually has a good point.	59
32	seems to have done you some good.	59
33	i gave you a good recommendation.	59
34	sounds like a good plan.	59
35	for every good memory, there's a slew of bad ones.	59
36	so you guys are trying to manipulate me by playing good cop/good cop?	59
37	capillary refill's good.	59
38	it was good enough for my dad.	59
39	which is good news for you.	59
40	it's good for a couple to share a hobby.	59
41	at the time, it seemed like a good idea.	59
42	ben, i-i don't think that's a good idea.	59
43	how do you expect to get into a good college?	59
44	then it's a good thing he has a.	59
45	what about the good stuff?	59
46	most good doctors are weird.	59
47	the good news is the poison didn't come from your wife.	59
48	everything looks good.	59
49	you think it's a good idea for me to go right back to my old life?	59
50	why exactly is that good for you?	59
51	good chance i'd find the two of you in the same cage.	59
52	you're really not good at reading people, are you?	59
53	you are a good man who made a mistake.	59
54	they scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and i worked my ass off.	59
55	oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone.	59
56	there are a lot of good administrators out there, not many good doctors.	59
57	he's in togood of shape.	59
58	he told me had a few glasses of wine, and that he shouldn't do it, but he also said that you were good.	59
59	it's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.	59
60	does this look like a good time?	59
61	could he know i'm good with a gun?	59
62	you think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here.	59
63	i guess i'm supposed to be the good cop.	59
64	my father keeps up a good front, but he's just like emory.	59
65	i think you're a good person and a fine doctor, but it's ridiculous to think anyone needs an arsenal of assault weapons.	59
66	took real good care of himself.	59
67	maybe he found out about her good friend.	59
68	and this time, a land war in russia will be a good idea.	59
69	which is a good thing, because neither gad nor systemic infection would cause anaphylaxis or tracheal edema.	59
70	arterial pulse is good.	59
71	it was for our own good, but i don't care.	59
72	i know i'm not any good at being a clown yet, but when i do get a laugh and see those kids' eyes light up, that's how my dad made me feel when i was a kid.	59
73	they were good parents.	59
74	saving one life is good.	59
75	i may be a little out of bounds here, but in case there are complications, it might be a good time to come clean to your son, let his father visit.	59
76	in the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town-- ladling kittens, spaying soup.	59
77	yeah, well, it's probably not a good idea, you know, with us working together.	59
78	you're not working for house anymore, which means you no longer have him to blame if you get caught.	31
79	means it's not zollinger-ellison.	31
80	it means we were wrong about lead.	31
81	orange means mercury.	31
82	which means he's both irascible and stupid.	31
83	just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs.	31
84	i know, which means you can't go either.	31
85	does that mean you like your new life?	31
86	which means you proved nothing.	31
87	i mean, i want to feel like i've earned my hookers.	31
88	but i didn't mean physical stress.	31
89	and rust means arsenic.	31
90	the fact that you see that as inherently bad means you're an irrational patriot.	31
91	and what's brown mean?	31
92	that would mean that every symptom after his t.i.a. was a coincidence.	31
93	although he can't take on any new clients right now, he's trying to get mean audition for one of those online soaps.	31
94	i'm sure it would mean a lot to him to see you.	31
95	it means you don't have to make that drive.	31
96	he means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.	31
97	i never meant to hurt my daughter.	31
98	means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.	31
99	left-sided pain means it could be angina, which is made worse by stress.	31
100	you do understand the meaning of the word confirm.	31
101	your shoes-- a different, expensive pair every day, but never leather, which means you're both rich and liberal.	31
102	it means he's not paranoid, is an idiot, and was poisoned.	31
103	osler scarf-- only on fridays, which means you did your residency at hopkins, which means you're smarter than our interactions would so far indicate.	31
104	and if i find a hole in the cartilage of his nose, right about here, then it means i'm right.	31
105	either your relationship just blows up like every other non-magical romance, or she stays with you but blames you for stripping all the meaning out of her life.	31
106	blue veil means you're a postulant, haven't taken your vows yet.	31
107	and since there's no way that you're doing her without me knowing, it means you were just doing her shampoo.	31
108	that doesn't mean i have a problem.	31
109	if foreman had called you in from home, you wouldn't have pressed clothes, coiffed hair, and makeup, which means you were already here in the hospital.	31
110	sorry, we got to make it a fair fight, which means you're stuck with her.	31
111	brown vestments means you're carmelites, cloistered nuns, which explains the chaperone.	31
112	what the hell does that mean?	31
113	and i mean that metaphorically, of course.	31
114	means you could stroke.	31
115	well, if it's not meaningless sex, kinda screams out for an end game.	31
116	which means i wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week by child locking all my cabinets, padding table corners, and getting rid of every single magazine.	31
117	i'd call you idiots again, but at this point i'm starting to doubt whether you understand what i mean by the word.	31
118	which means you're not just a reject, you're a cowardly reject who was trying to hide her rejectedness from someone.	31
119	the risk is 1 in 4,000 i could die during surgery, which means, if i don't donate, i'm valuing my life at 4,000 times someone else's.	31
120	i guess, i mean-- yes, technically, i was thinking.	31
121	ooh, i mean, that's pricy, but it can be done.	31
122	and by you, i mean me.	31
123	if we increase the steroids, then either death comes slower, which means we were too late with the gad, or death comes faster, which means we were too stupid with the infection.	31
124	which means you're both idiots.	31
125	it means i've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.	31
126	and i knew that meant making certain sacrifices.	31
127	means this donation was given under duress.	31
128	yes, we knew what kawah meant.	31
129	well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee.	31
130	now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for.	31
131	that means low self-esteem.	31
132	which means that foreman signed off on it, which means that he set all the wheels in motion.	31
133	the facts say you should be suspended, which, from what i understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.	31
134	i just mean the part about the odds of it happening.	31
135	no, i meant, what was it?	31
136	which means that you're hanging out in the hospital pretending to work.	31
137	y-you mean the treatment will, um.	31
138	you mean all of us or just us?	31
139	which means he goes home.	31
140	we're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this.	31
141	he didn't realize sharing a cell also meant sharing the air?	31
142	which means you didn't prove that i have a gun.	31
143	which means it's too late for me to back down.	31
144	the only way that has any meaning is if we fix the lungs and transplant them.	31
145	which means you were out late drinking with some new girl or because there is no new girl.	31
146	the test is designed to determine if you're-- no, i mean your running a test and discharging me.	31
147	means we're wrong about infection.	31
148	it probably doesn't mean anything, but we want to make sure.	31
149	that'd mean the damage was permanent.	31
150	and by money, you mean all your money.	31
151	it means he's got a tumor.	31
152	i mean, in the guest room.	31
153	and mom's determination to keep dad away, even as her kid gets sicker and sicker, means she's got more to hide.	31
154	i mean, do you think my father would have done that for ten minutes?	31
155	other than the fact that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships.	31
156	one dead lobe means four alive ones.	31
157	does that mean you also have it?	31
158	his fever's going through the roof, which means we were wrong about gad and the steroids kicked the infection into high gear.	31
159	and i do mean rule out.	31
160	but you know that, which means.	31
161	i mean, what am i supposed to do?	31
162	when you say your boyfriend hit you, it means you actually hit yourself.	31
163	he means it's not lemierre's, but it's still an infection, which is why it's spreading so rapidly.	31
164	tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.	31
165	which means not family.	31
166	the way galaxies rotate, the motion of the universe, it means there's six times more stuff than we can detect.	31
167	which doesn't mean he's not still sick.	31
168	i mean, i hope to god i never have to use one.	31
169	which means he wasn't really hurt.	31
170	which means it's also safe to assume that he trusts you.	31
171	that doesn't mean you couldn't get angry.	31
172	i mean, not-- not really.	31
173	which means your initial diagnosis could still be right.	31
174	and this means a lot to me.	31
175	i mean, even if you are right about it, why take your word over mine?	31
176	i mean, he's constantly reminded of her.	31
177	meanwhile, he's keeping you here searching for a plan that doesn't even exist.	31
178	you were the residency director at hopkins before you moved to mercy, which means it's safe to assume that you trained foreman.	31
179	we got the patient's eye back in place with steroid injections, but a bulging eyeball means it's not a liver problem.	31
180	you mean like we should be more optimistic?	31
181	it means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.	31
182	it's a family heirloom, which means old money.	31
183	that means he didn't get in trouble for drinking.	31
184	i mean, he was closer to callie than i was, and i missed him.	31
185	he has alzheimer's! it's freezing outside, and he's sick! i mean, you don't even know what it is yet, do you?	31
186	and by we, you mean you.	31
187	yeah, i paged you, which means you're next.	31
188	i mean, you'll escalate, and then i'll retaliate, and the cycle will continue until we've both gone too far, at which point, i'll.	31
189	neither of us is ready to give up on the marriage.	28
190	now that happened either because dr.	28
191	either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in new jersey.	28
192	the only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying.	28
193	oh, we kiss and cuddle, but neither one of us is interested in sex.	28
194	well, i'd take me if either of us could.	28
195	neither of you stepped out between periods, get beer, pick up a pizza?	28
196	either way, we don't get his temperature above 95, it's not going to matter.	28
197	i gather from the silence that either you all agree with chase or you're just staring at his emasculated brow.	28
198	she has to either dump him or forgive him.	28
199	it's either gotta be his cell or his work station.	28
200	and you ain't gonna rat me out neither, 'cause you don't wanna get a snitch jacket and wind up shanked in the showers.	28
201	how could i comprehend that you're too despised to keep them from having the same name, too overwhelmed to remember your own calendar, and too vain to admit that at this stage, you don't matter to either baby.	28
202	in either case, test for hiv and do an mri to rule out tumors.	28
203	so it's either not sclerosis or it's extremely aggressive sclerosis.	28
204	you're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.	28
205	and neither should you.	28
206	he doesn't test positive for that either.	28
207	i don't blame either one.	28
208	so either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you.	28
209	either way, it's more interesting than whatever you're doing now.	28
210	and that haircut isn't helping, either.	28
211	with neurological symptoms progressing this fast, he's dead either way.	28
212	tularemia doesn't always show up in blood work either.	28
213	either a hot tub or a sauna.	28
214	your pants are a size too short, so either you grew a couple of inches or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.	28
215	either way, i'm covered.	28
216	you can't, and neither can i.	28
217	you're either preparing to fight pacquiao or you're having one heck of a bad day.	28
218	and neither has the job, right?	28
219	she's not drinking the coffee either.	28
220	either you're getting her gifts because you want her to like you, in which case i don't like you, or you're getting her gifts to screw with her.	28
221	neither have you-- analyze it however you like.	28
222	which is why you're not gonna live there either.	28
223	because no matter how much you wanted to believe in this chaste romance, you didn't buy it either.	28
224	we're treating you for an overactive thyroid.	21
225	i treated an inmate once with similar symptoms after he tried to poison his cellmate with chlorine gas.	21
226	you have a dead patient?	21
227	how do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the patient?	21
228	an untreated schizoid disorder he's finally lost the ability to suppress.	21
229	and you can tell taub that he's gonna get the same treatment as this heavy bag if he doesn't cut this crap out.	21
230	now that we know what it is, he'll need treatment, but he'll live.	21
231	how can he not be dead?	21
232	how do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?	21
233	'cause he'll be dead if he doesn't get one in the next few hours.	21
234	blood smear was clear, and we idiots treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.	21
235	well, i hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for.	21
236	or it's gad, and we started treatment too late.	21
237	wants treatment for diabetes.	21
238	wh-what if i don't want the treatment?	21
239	some kinds of pressure-treated wood can contain arsenic.	21
240	but the steroids would have treated for that.	21
241	she treated it like it never happened.	21
242	24-year-oldwater treatment worker with pyrexia and double vision.	21
243	pffftt! then i will come in dead of night working late?	21
244	go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.	21
245	spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more humanely.	21
246	two of you start treatment with corticosteroids and epinephrine while you run the scratch test.	21
247	let's get the lungs on treatment.	21
248	then this treatment will burn holes in the lungs.	21
249	we can't treat an underage patient without a guardian-- we need to call social services.	21
250	when you treat, and he gets better, and doesn't give bob cratchit christmas day off, you owe me a coffee.	21
251	and i lose my temper when someone suggests that a handful of pop-psych catch phrases can control our most seminal, intractable, and natural reaction to a dead child.	21
252	not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.	21
253	there are 70,000 people in this country on the active waiting list for a kidney, and less than 10,000 dead people a year to give them one.	21
254	well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat.	21
255	it's better to think the man's dead but decent.	21
256	have you ever heard of the north american man/dead boy love association?	21
257	we're gonna find the dead kid's stash.	21
258	as soon as he breathed in all that cigar smoke, he was a dead man.	21
259	i could have you checked into a facility that exclusively treats mental disorders.	21
260	and although his kids are old enough to want daddy dead, they're still to young to do anything about it.	21
261	you have to have the treatment.	21
262	treat her for alcoholism.	21
263	if adams is right, he'll spike a fever, get hypotensive, we can treat it.	21
264	start treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin.	21
265	treat the patient with activated protein c.	21
266	here, it's considered a normal and treatable condition.	21
267	every moment we waste looking for a phantom infection is time we could be treating him.	21
268	so we discussed it a little longer, and house decided to treat with heparin.	21
269	is endocarditis treatable?	21
270	there's no treatment for it.	21
271	so you treated with steroids.	21
272	are there any side effects to the treatment?	21
273	since i have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him.	21
274	dead patients usually get a lower standard of care.	21
275	is this from the alcohol treatment?	21
276	so, yeah, you'll treat him for lupus.	21
277	iv immunosuppressant to treat.	21
278	treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.	21
279	he isn't gonna put himself back in jail over a dead kid.	21
280	we needed a treatment that was a.	21
281	hopefully, what's left will be enough so we can start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	21
282	just can't stand to think of all those patients going untreated because i don't have the resources to do my best work.	21
283	which is why i had them admit him anyway and treat with alprazolam.	21
284	you should have told me you were treating an underage clinic patient.	21
285	we also need to confirm and treat whatever's making him sick.	21
286	they should be dead by now.	21
287	infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.	21
288	i think we should treat with high-dose, broad-spectrum-- which will kill him if it's a gad autoimmunity.	21
289	can't treat for both.	21
290	he's doing the treatment.	21
291	you do have to treat me appropriately.	21
292	shouldn't we wait for the biopsy results before we start treatment?	21
293	which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat.	21
294	what would you think if you found out years later your beloved dead wife cheated on you?	21
295	not dead until he's warm and dead.	21
296	i need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.	21
297	start treatment with steroids.	21
298	i thought i was here to treat the patients, not entertain you.	21
299	dead kid's house was on the way to my apartment.	21
300	sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment.	21
301	the fact that he's dead makes it more interesting.	21
302	because he doesn't treat them like scum.	21
303	there are very serious risks, but if we don't figure out what he has, we can't treat him at all.	21
304	calcium channel blocker to treat.	21
305	now she can't--there's no reason for us not to call.	17
306	perfectly reasonable explanation.	17
307	well, how about the reason that there's no reason?	17
308	it stands to reason that your emotions factored in.	17
309	we did a major operation for no reason.	17
310	same reason he'd never tell you that he's thought about having sex with you.	17
311	he's got no reason to lie to me.	17
312	there's gotta be a deeper reason.	17
313	we have a reasoned disagreement.	17
314	there's a reason we're locked away from nice, normal people.	17
315	and that you were the reason.	17
316	100 bucks says i can find a medical reason why she doesn't want to have sex.	17
317	the deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.	17
318	so you made daddy go away and you made sure junior had no reason to go looking.	17
319	you're the reason i'm out of the big house.	17
320	any reason i shouldn't?	17
321	reasonable theory, supported by the evidence.	17
322	that voice in the hall that none of us have any reason to be listening to is not surprisingly wrong.	17
323	turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.	17
324	and you're a felon, so you'll end up back in jail-- that is actually not one of the many reasons that i don't own a gun.	17
325	i started with 10 million, and i couldn't think of a reason not to give 20.	17
326	i don't think stockpiling weapons is the most reasoned response, but, given what i've seen at bloomingdale's on black friday, i wouldn't say it rises to the level of mental illness.	17
327	not for your reasons.	17
328	no, there's no reason to search for a bodily rash since lupus doesn't usually present that way.	17
329	whatever the reason, it boils down to the fact that you may never walk again because house created an atmosphere that promotes recklessness.	17
330	well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.	14
331	lungs, rash, now excessive r-r variability.	14
332	he didn't have a rash.	14
333	in my opinion at the time, it was the rash that was gonna kill him.	14
334	take off your shirt so i can find the rash.	14
335	i thought i was right about the rash.	14
336	if the kid had a rash or some circulation issue.	14
337	once we establish rhythm, any accidental movement could crash him back into v-fib.	14
338	we can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't reverse brain damage if we go too slowly.	14
339	also explains the motorcycle crash.	14
340	that comes with a rash.	14
341	big amounts of smoke, that's enough to trash a lung.	14
342	he broke out with a rash right after i tested with the wheat-allergy swab, but none of his blood samples show he's allergic to it.	14
343	he's late for a trashcan fire.	14
344	the neuro symptoms and the rash were both signs of an underlying disease.	14
345	they missed your son's rash.	14
346	you have a bit of a rash.	14
347	it's a little weird without the rash, but it fits all of his other symptoms.	14
348	can't hurt to biopsy the rash while we're waiting.	14
349	it's not that i was trying to prove that you're an idiot or anything, but lupus boy and i were at the beach this morning, and i noticed a rash on his left thigh.	14
350	shingles could cause chest pain before a rash appeared.	14
351	it should open up the airways and buy you some time until the lungs are ready.	13
352	the lungs are a smoker.	13
353	but those lungs need the air force and the marines, antibodies raining down from above.	13
354	yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head?	13
355	if our donor had an allergy, it could explain the lungs.	13
356	we're still working on the lungs.	13
357	you have a brain tumor, okay?	13
358	renal failure, lung failure, heart failure, all before we started chemo.	13
359	we killed part of the lung.	13
360	my job is to assist you in curing the lungs.	13
361	ready for the donor lungs.	13
362	take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.	13
363	he had a brain tumor.	13
364	left lung is pinking up.	13
365	wilson needs these lungs.	13
366	it's a slow-growing tumor.	13
367	massive amounts choke up the lungs.	13
368	coke never got past the lungs.	13
369	the team closed her up, put the lungs in suspended animation.	13
370	the tumor interferes with certain natural systems.	13
371	your patient is two lungs in a box.	13
372	tell that to the tumor that i found in his arm.	13
373	the x-ray didn't show any tumors.	13
374	our patient's lung problem is not a lung problem.	13
375	analyzing part of this tumor is gonna be quicker than a scan.	13
376	add that to some peripheral red-green confusion, puts my money-- excuse me, your money-- soon to be my money on a tumor near his pituitary.	13
377	i'd like to try forcing an oxygen-rich slurry into your lungs.	13
378	they found the tumor.	13
379	but once they hatched, the worms got to work on her lungs, her ear, the nerves in her legs.	13
380	your husband has a tumor in his lymph nodes.	13
381	looks like someone else will be getting the lungs.	13
382	you're thinking lung cancer.	13
383	you screwed up the lungs.	13
384	the heparin could cause the patient to bleed into his lungs even faster.	13
385	the hospital brought in a consultant to work on the lungs.	13
386	squamous cell middle ear tumor could have caused the ear bleed.	13
387	must be bleeding into his lungs.	13
388	that mass wasn't a tumor.	13
389	some nausea, dizziness, and as the tumor shrinks, there will be behavioral changes.	13
390	surgeons had the recipient on the table when they realized the lungs had increased airway resistance.	13
391	so why did chelation make the lungs worse?	13
392	if only burnt lungs explained the passing out and paralysis.	13
393	especially since, with the extent of the emphysema, she needs a double lung.	13
394	listen, i'm trying to listen to your lungs, not your self-pity.	13
395	if they're hiding inside the lung cells.	13
396	all the money's on tumor.	13
397	and his urine and blood tests didn't show any evidence of an adrenaline-secreting tumor.	13
398	25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got.	13
399	vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry.	13
400	together with the lung, it added up to wegener's.	13
401	so i for sure got lung cancer?	13
402	even if your patient dies, someone will get the lungs.	13
403	finding a tumor that's flushing adrenaline through his system is gonna take all night.	13
404	the lung donor didn't have cancer.	13
405	what if the lung involvement came first?	13
406	if you're right, calcium channel blocker the lungs have no nervous system.	13
407	how'd you even know to look for a tumor?	13
408	she got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells.	13
409	the lungs will never be viable for transplant.	13
410	diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts.	13
411	it's called tumor lysis syndrome.	13
412	burned his lungs, which is why he coughed up blood.	13
413	if there's even a chance i'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else.	12
414	his kidneys died, they transfused.	12
415	root canal, if done correctly, doesn't look like kidney disease.	12
416	patient went from asymptomatic to fried kidneys in less than a year.	12
417	i have polycystic kidney disease.	12
418	this kidney thing is the only evidence you have that he's sick.	12
419	the nitro is dropping the blood flow to your kidneys.	12
420	almost always hits the kidneys.	12
421	house, she really needs this kidney.	12
422	could have kidney involvement.	12
423	his heart, liver, kidneys were all toast.	12
424	you the guy, the kidney donor?	12
425	it explains the paralysis, the bleeding, the heart and kidney issues, everything.	12
426	what looks like kidney disease, but isn't?	12
427	why do you wanna give away your kidney?	12
428	fresh plasma will replace the damaged red blood cells that are clogging his kidneys.	12
429	a couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.	12
430	you give away two kidneys, and you die.	12
431	your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my patient with renal failure.	12
432	vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fever.	12
433	it's a genetic condition characterized by kidney failure, bronchial myomas, mees' lines, and deafness.	12
434	he's giving a kidney to someone he's never met?	12
435	apparently someone forgot that it was daddy's night.	11
436	ah, shut it off! apparently we're allowed to do this now.	11
437	i usually have a student aide help me set it up, and apparently this year he added extra hydrofluoric acid, which is why it exploded.	11
438	pull! i'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently i'd miss.	11
439	apparently, someone identifying themselves as dr.	11
440	it's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take a little ignorance with her bliss.	11
441	house is here and apparently prepping for an operation that will probably kill a patient.	11
442	apparently, you were right about that one.	11
443	i just believe people are capable of more than you do, apparently.	11
444	which apparently really bugs you.	11
445	you're apparently asymptomatic.	11
446	negative chest x-rays aren't.	8
447	all you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.	8
448	if it's a synthetic problem, more fluid will leak into h chest and his heart will fail.	8
449	there's no sign of atelectasis or infiltrates on the chest x-ray.	8
450	do you feel any tightness in your chest?	8
451	i'm gonna get through eventually.	8
452	it came from a little bastard of a bacterium whose crap can cause chest pain, respiratory distress, skin ulcers, the growth of pseudomembrane across the airway, and, in very rare cases, hallucinations.	8
453	won't her chest pain come back?	8
454	he'll notice it eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.	8
455	because, eventually, he'll ask you to cross it.	8
456	oh, yes, they do! they're gonna find out eventually.	8
457	you're gonna misplace one of them eventually.	8
458	cocaine abuse can cause paranoia and chest pain.	8
459	eventually, you'll pass boredom and get to bonding.	8
460	eventually, you will screw something up.	8
461	you manufactured conflict with me so eventually you could let me win.	8
462	if it's only in his epithelium, it wouldn't show up in his chest x-ray.	8
463	and don't even pretend like you're not relieved.	7
464	wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.	7
465	bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.	7
466	you make her feel guilty.	7
467	so now you're pretending to be on call so that your overly protective boyfriend won't find out that you got groped.	7
468	this whole thing was about your ankle monitor.	7
469	you feel guilty about leaving.	7
470	maybe she likes the sound of my voice, which is weird because i have no genetic connection to her.	7
471	my guilt over my mom is why i put up with my dad.	7
472	but orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night.	7
473	now i have swollen ankles.	7
474	but not guilty enough to stop seeing her.	7
475	emory was a wonderful man.	7
476	no, you wanna like boring.	7
477	you have to believe that every parent screws up every child or you were screwed out of a decent childhood.	7
478	my, uh, my eye feels weird.	7
479	your biological father was a decent, god-fearing minister.	7
480	you hold her hand, get the sister to beg, stick your fingers in your ears, pretend you can't hear.	7
481	i'm guessing ankle monitor.	7
482	thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.	7
483	i know that sounds weird, but.	7
484	you called up, pretended to be neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement.	7
485	then i started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?	7
486	you're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?	7
487	but all the time i had my ankle monitor on, i was furious that i couldn't.	7
488	it's not an admission of guilt.	7
489	oh, this is much better! i said it was boring.	7
490	but it doesn't have to be awkward and weird.	7
491	turns out i like boring.	7
492	so about the inhaler for my asthma, i was-- sorry! hospital policy specifically prohibits me from giving meds to unrelated homeless people pretending to be father and daughter.	7
493	your guilt is between you and your wife.	7
494	sure, i'll feel guilty, start doubting.	7
495	i got an order here to deactivate and remove his ankle monitor.	7
496	personally, i applaud your decision to step down off your cross and get on with your life, but your misplaced guilt is shutting down your brain.	7
497	no wonder you have such insight into my relationship with my babies.	7
498	something very obvious and very boring.	7
499	it's called alice in wonderland syndrome.	7
500	the medical term is cankles.	7
501	she said, i've been a fellow for two months, and i'm kind of weird.	7
502	people who just get off on weird cases.	7
503	you already kn this, but you pretend you don't because it makes you feel civilized.	7
504	but if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored.	7
505	while i'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that i'm seriously considering that idea.	7
506	i get that you're scared and guilty.	7
507	except for the annoying guilt about the husband.	7
508	it's not the place to exorcise your guilt.	7
509	a little less guilty about seeing her.	7
510	no wonder you're playing handsies with her.	7
511	you made nice-nice with phil, you decided that he'd make a decent father for thing 2 after all.	7
512	from here who can we trust i wonder what happens now.	7
513	i got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees-- you know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.	7
514	where's that petition house's p.o. sent over about getting his ankle monitor off?	7
515	now the sex is both commitment- and guilt-free.	7
516	do we owe this case to your guilt at having ignored your own forgetful mommy?	7
517	like an idiot, i went out with my girlfriends to pretend i have a life, when all i did was flirt with guys who'd have no interest in a mom, miss the baby i couldn't wait to get rid of, and then get yelled at by my mom for staying out too late.	7
518	i genuinely wonder who they belong to.	7
519	does a friend watch you where it's happening, and wonder why?	7
520	it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right.	7
521	clever tactic, pretending you're not interested anymore.	7
522	or it's just rich guilt.	7
523	used to have to pretend i was scared.	7
524	guilt-colored glasses.	7
525	you're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here.	7
526	now we're back to boring reality reality.	7
527	orgasms oxygenate the brain, lighting up over 30 different areas and making us forget how boring susie cooper is.	7
528	they are kind of boring.	7
529	you don't have to feel so guilty anymore.	7
530	so that's really weird.	7
531	kiddie-winkies! i wonder who they belong to.	7
532	supposed to talk to his p.o. about getting his ankle monitor off early.	7
533	probably just a really, really decent person.	7
534	he may just be shooting himself in the ankle.	7
535	my decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom.	7
536	hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?	7
537	you have a wonderful way of communicating.	7
538	work in some boring office?	7
539	first off, be a decent, empathetic person.	7
540	you owe me a new pair of pants.	6
541	excess adrenaline can cause heart problems and.	6
542	she couldn't handle the thought of being on meds.	6
543	or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.	6
544	she can barely catch her breath.	6
545	if i had the power to veto him, given all the crap i've put up with over the years, don't know if i could use it objectively.	6
546	angiography showed a hemorrhagic site in the left lower lobe.	6
547	and i barely even have $100 and.	6
548	are you real or just something from wanderlust who can you trust when tears we flower house.	6
549	the best halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation.	6
550	systemic sclerosis can cause lower extremity ulcers.	6
551	you're allowed to go home.	6
552	blood chemistry showed high ammonia.	6
553	you'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.	6
554	i can barely look her in the eyes anymore.	6
555	followed your advice and took the night off.	6
556	i borrowed it from one of the nurses.	6
557	patient complained of a sore throat a few weeks ago.	6
558	you handle him and his wife.	6
559	no, now they're sore.	6
560	as for santos, his handlers tell us that he's done more roadwork than at any time in his career, hoping to prove tonight that he can box for 12 full rounds.	6
561	short occlusion time of the artery, when the swelling goes down, you should.	6
562	we got him breathing, but barely.	6
563	yeah, it's much more likely that i'm taking this case because i miss showering with cro-magnons than that i actually happen to find it interesting.	6
564	you're allowed to be at the hospital.	6
565	rollo followed me in and took it.	6
566	he barely said a couple of words and set the boy off.	6
567	if that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.	6
568	and extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.	6
569	so now you're preparing a powerpoint presentation to keep her in your garden of earthly delights.	6
570	lawyers say i'm not allowed to.	6
571	making this yet another interaction with you it's not my fault you can't handle your patient.	6
572	got a patient with end stage renal disease.	6
573	because of his heart problems, but-- once something gets taken off the board, i'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on.	6
574	just a sore throat a few weeks ago.	6
575	all my friends' parents were divorced or having affairs or barely knew their kids' birthdays.	6
576	you handle his house.	6
577	with great power comes great micromanaging.	6
578	interesting that you never showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer.	6
579	rhabdomyolysis fits the vomiting, pigmenturia, and renal failure.	6
580	i sure hope this alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and manpower just to let this guy watch his mind shrivel and keep his wife miserable.	6
581	lowering his libido and causing erectile dysfunction.	6
582	no! your lips are swelling.	6
583	house handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?	6
584	he comes in with 11 straight knockout wins and we saw how a power puncher with a left hook was able to cut rubio over the right eye in the tenth round of that last fight.	6
585	more dangerous than complete renal failure?	6
586	you owe me 106,804 won.	6
587	those flowers are from last week.	6
588	there was nothing owed.	6
589	could come from the patient's illness, or it could come from the fact that you allowed him to saunter out of your hospital and take a nap in the snow.	6
590	stress wouldn't be relevant, but anything that increases his adrenalin could have made it worse.	6
591	it lowers libido and causes erectile dysfunction.	6
592	patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.	6
593	there are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk?	6
594	see if i can handle working with him.	6
595	now that he has the power, he won't be able to resist the temptation to use it.	6
596	violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict.	6
597	excuse me, but only family members are allowed.	6
598	when my mother drank, she couldn't handle me, so she locked me in my father's study.	6
599	double shifts, just to keep the power on.	6
600	noradrenaline and near-death experiences.	6
601	you felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.	6
602	could you just lower your voice?	6
603	ben, you barely knew him.	6
604	you were trying to make up time by showering at the hospital because you're too lazy to buy your own shampoo.	6
605	you're moving slower.	6
606	so the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat.	6
607	did he meet your patient with renal failure?	6
608	you showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.	6
609	she uses crushed aspirin in the water to make the flowers last longer.	6
610	when your dad showed up unexpectedly, house have a hand in that?	6
611	but he never had the power to overrule me.	6
612	head ct showed no signs of stroke or hemorrhage.	6
613	swelling that fast and localized has to come from the lymph nodes.	6
614	i could barely breathe.	6
615	you don't have to work for house, but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.	6
616	i'm just glad that the symptoms showed up before you left for china.	6
617	given that martin brodeur was scheduled to start but bowed out after taking a shot to the throat in warm-up.	6
618	swelling would have followed gravity.	6
619	and a lot of people owe me wedding gifts.	6
620	you're not allowed out.	6
621	much as i'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole.	6
622	i just don't want to indulge your-- lupus.	6
623	it's nothing i can't handle.	6
624	angioneurotic edema can cause rapid swelling.	6
625	i vowed i wouldn't let that happen to me.	6
626	i don't know if you're power crazed or paranoid, but i know she's right.	6
627	trousseau's syndrome could send clots, cause the ischemic foot.	5
628	bok choy has glucosinolates which inhibit thyroid function and account for all your symptoms.	5
629	peek-a-boo! why would anita tell her husband about our affair?	5
630	this is a thyroid issue.	5
631	approaching the clot.	5
632	if it's not poison, it's most likely atrial fibrillation brought on by hyperthyroidism or sleep apnea.	5
633	i could do a clotting test.	5
634	you're increasing the odds of that every second we waste here.	5
635	he's fighting for his honor.	5
636	i found stains on his clothes.	5
637	it's a clot in the radicular artery.	5
638	after having been rejected explains the clothes.	5
639	apathetic hyperthyroidism.	5
640	clotting parameters are normal.	5
641	if he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the x-ray to do the autopsy.	5
642	excuse me, your honor, may i approach?	5
643	he has a nodule in his thyroid.	5
644	we're not having an affair.	5
645	and if we induce v-fib, odds say that we'll be able to revive him.	5
646	i got it from the health fair i was working at.	5
647	if we add clotting disorder to the symptoms, it's gotta be a toxin.	5
648	your honor, may i submit the chronicle sports page from october 10th?	5
649	i'm not really an affair guy after all.	5
650	it's got to be a clot keeping her from bleeding out.	5
651	to live, oh and i've been trying hard against unbelievable odds gets so hard in times like now to hold on but guns they wait to be stuck by thirteen.	5
652	nice clothes and anger.	5
653	but if it's completely clotted, it may indicate cancer.	5
654	you don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife, not unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.	5
655	your honor, may i submit the sports page from the new jersey chronicle on october 9th, 2011.	5
656	his thyroid levels were within normal range when he was admitted.	5
657	what about another clotting problem?	5
658	not worth more than my honor.	5
659	if you're a match, but to increase our odds, we'd like to get your friends and faly tested as well.	5
660	and if it's not a clot?	5
661	the health fair is one of my responsibilities.	5
662	the fact that that would-be widow came in just in time to sob all over your soft, mushy heart and the fact that her husband's gonna live does not change whether or not i did the right thing.	5
663	i can't decide whether to take out an i told you so ad in the new england journal or stay classy and just spray-paint it on your car.	5
664	it seems like graves disease or some other thyroid issue.	5
665	you just lost interest once it stopped being an affair.	5
666	although, to be fair, i am large.	5
667	you have to give him something he values more than honor.	5
668	running away from home is a time-honored tradition, but you're not doing it to flee your parents.	5
669	we can also provide clothes for the interview if you need them.	5
670	although, to be fair, every man you've ever met has thought about having sex with you.	5
671	and if he has factor 5 leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.	5
672	the affair with that girl.	5
673	infected blood and tissue everywhere you look.	4
674	because he sees insecurity, and when house senses weakness, he pounces, and because his insecurity is the fact that other people can have faith and don't have the obsessive need for physical proof.	4
675	it's tissue inflammation.	4
676	everyone except adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.	4
677	with you and your wife's consent, we can get an exhumation order.	4
678	you can't argue away my faith.	4
679	get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein.	4
680	i'll try the marrow registry.	4
681	that's not from a fungal infection.	4
682	i'm not saying i don't have faith.	4
683	your soul sister is having a fungal infection from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.	4
684	one requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant, and we couldn't even get the kid a marrow match.	4
685	not a fungal infection.	4
686	use cross-matched platelets.	4
687	transfusing his platelets will keep him healthy while we wait.	4
688	patient has low platelets.	4
689	you turning back to your long-abandoned faith in time of trouble?	4
690	how can there be that much tissue.	4
691	i can't go back there! you may have a fungal infection.	4
692	kid needs a bone marrow transplant.	4
693	she's throwing away her life because of blind faith.	4
694	the problem isn't his marrow.	4
695	we know there are some issues there, but your bone marrow could cure him.	4
696	ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.	4
697	otherwise, we might not be able to find a marrow match.	4
698	low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals.	4
699	fungal infection's off the table.	4
700	and you'll never get her consent.	4
701	patient's having an allergic reaction to donor platelets.	4
702	where they hung out, quietly and asymptomatically, biding their time till, somewhere along the way, they got knocked loose.	3
703	just drive me to the hospital.	3
704	acute onset points to tularemia.	3
705	he's not in the hospital.	3
706	his mother feels it's better to do the test at a different hospital.	3
707	then you can ask foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.	3
708	i haven't left the hospital in four days.	3
709	we also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet.	3
710	if i were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, i would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way and-- sorry.	3
711	so go back to work at the hospital.	3
712	sorry, but after park sent out here hospital-wide non-apology apology this morning, i assume that plagiarism is the new black.	3
713	if you want, i could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time.	3
714	despite what the media would have us believe, you think we live in a very safe world.	3
715	what about the psychotic break?	3
716	that the defendant couldn't have possibly committed the robbery because he was with you watching martin brodeur shut out the rangers.	3
717	i told him to tell his wife he cheated, not confess every sin he's ever committed.	3
718	i'll give $1 million as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.	3
719	we've got to get you back to the hospital right away.	3
720	before i ask any of you to sacrifice three months of your life for me, i have a confession.	3
721	he was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans.	3
722	he has to base his decisions on what's best for the entire hospital.	3
723	but there is thickening in the lining of the wall of the third ventricle.	3
724	we all knew a psychotic episode was one of the three possible outcomes.	3
725	foreman, since telling people how to do their job is your job, but when your less-than-competent administration of this hospital affects what's written on my whiteboard.	3
726	i'm a little confused.	3
727	at least we know tracheal edema isn't from anything we did because we're not doing anything.	3
728	those consultants in my office are only costing the hospital 100 bucks every minute i keep them waiting.	3
729	i got one final confession to make.	3
730	i hung it up because someone had to run this place after cuddy left.	3
731	closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away.	3
732	you knew that your patient was at risk for a psychotic break when you brought a scalpel within his reach.	3
733	as soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.	3
734	i'm an asset to this hospital, an asset you're about to lose to chicago.	3
735	flout my authority, make the hospital look bad, back to jail.	3
736	despite the fact that i know there's a gun in here, i'd never find it because you are more devious-- - clever.	3
737	if you keep being stubborn, he will keep being stubborn.	3
738	he said, i've been working at this hospital for 15 years and i'm taking self-improvement classes.	3
739	you need to get cotton swabs-- but not now.	3
740	you can't leave the hospital.	3
741	i'm starting to think, mendelson, that you just really like the taste of my spit.	3
742	to make him miserable or to forfeit your license?	3
743	i think your symptoms are the result of alcohol abuse.	3
744	you're not the only one whose life spiraled out of control when you got knifed in the ventricle.	3
745	i suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by childhood abuse.	3
746	ventricles are clear too.	3
747	yeah, why would i wanna make sure that my homicidal cellmate is taking the right anti-psychotics?	3
748	s08e05 the confession by mikhel for: subtitulos.	3
749	why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?	3
750	sis and i were talking, trying to figure out how many hospital sleepovers we've had.	3
751	god, but you're petty.	3
752	if your mom abused you, social services won't let you go home with her.	3
753	hereditary angioedema or systemic mastocytosis could mimic anaphylaxis.	3
754	are you trying to prove that i was distracted, that my judgment was compromised?	3
755	not outside the walls of this hospital.	3
756	i'm guessing silver nitrate mixed with petroleum jelly that your boss put on the petty cash so he'd know who to have arrested for stealing it.	3
757	the whole town knows that you're in the hospital.	3
758	i would be urging you to make a stupid, stubborn decision that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.	3
759	you're in the hospital.	3
760	your son ben is in the hospital, at princeton-plainsboro.	3
761	you're in a hospital.	3
762	it's the swab for wheat-based allergies.	3
763	if you'd like to talk to someone, we do have grief counselors at the hospital.	3
764	just because you hung up your lab coat for more money and a bigger office?	3
765	only so many hours you can cry and bang on the door before you give up, find something to read.	3
766	made a laceration in the left ventricle about the size of the tip of my index finger.	3
767	dean of medicine from your old hospital.	3
768	that's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.	3
769	you were saying something about how i should, like, uh, swab or-- you're confusing me with the clinic again.	3
770	the fact that you managed to smear jelly on nearly every page.	3
771	guess i'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where i get all my meals since i can't go anywhere.	3
772	the donor spends a week in the hospita and up to three months convalescing at home.	3
773	i was angry, but i wasn't distracted.	3
774	you pull the trigger, i drool a little fake blood, and then i spit out the bullet that the audience thinks i caught in my teeth.	3
775	what if it wasn't an accident?	3
776	she was in a car accident when she was two.	3
777	about your disease, how it made you confess to crimes you hadn't committed.	3
778	i think you refer to it as petty cash.	3
779	pretty sure there's one in the hospital.	3
780	house was like the child catcher from chitty chitty bang bang.	3
781	i've decided that i would be doing this hospital a disservice if i did anything to change that process.	3
782	there's definitely no poisons i could have accidentally been exposed to at home.	3
783	you never told me what caused your accident.	3
784	an entire hospital betting on the legitimacy of my kids?	3
785	he has no schistocytes in his smear.	3
786	you came to the hospital with beer in your pocket.	3
787	in a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.	3
788	we're in the hospital.	3
789	your catheter bag is empty, despite taking in 200 ccs of fluids.	3
790	the blast will fry what's left of his liver.	3
791	plaques could be confused for nodules.	3
792	there's a hospital two miles from here.	3
793	and if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.	3
794	as it grew larger, so did the confessions.	3
795	house ordered a therapeutic bath first to wash off any residual chemicals from the blast.	3
796	acute etoh ingestion could have-- hey, paint around them! who's painting?	3
797	the motorcycle accident was an unnecessary dramatic flourish.	3
798	check the ventricles.	3
799	we're going to the hospital for tests.	3
800	house has established that that's okay in his world, or his prank war distracted you, or house makes medicine a game, and you just wanted to beat him.	3
801	i'm walter cofield, chief of neurology, mercy hospital.	3
802	no, i'm just going through a bit of withdrawal.	2
803	vitamin k deficiency's a bust.	2
804	my job is to be the jerk.	2
805	though i can't speak to the details of the case while my disciplinary hearing is pending, i want you to know that i have completed voluntary sexual harassment training.	2
806	so i had to convince you that i'd given up looking.	2
807	this case boils down to he said, she said.	2
808	we need to get reckless and extreme.	2
809	your boss uses blackmail, and you question my professional ethics?	2
810	pissing contest with foreman.	2
811	andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not aa.	2
812	i'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling and try to make a go of this.	2
813	low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives.	2
814	that'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.	2
815	it's grandpa's slight deafness that gave the game away.	2
816	you're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.	2
817	whatever age, living on the street makes her vulnerable to malnutrition, drug use, h.i.v. , all things which could explain her symptoms.	2
818	you can punch me in the face, kick me in the nuts.	2
819	come back after you're convinced that i'm healthy, and i will give you your money.	2
820	match, bout, fight, contest, day, helena.	2
821	just enough to make him irrationally generous, make him vulnerable to overheating.	2
822	you wear badly processed polyester all day and night for days and nights, you get antimony poisoning which caused your diarrhea and your numbness in your hands.	2
823	i saved her from brain damage.	2
824	the word transient is right there in the name.	2
825	tracin' faces i'm craving nachos.	2
826	vomiting must have torn the lining.	2
827	i'm only moving it to china because i'm craving egg foo yung.	2
828	i wasn't exactly wrestling with great theological questions.	2
829	your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.	2
830	charges of child exploitation against american companies have been blown way out of proportion.	2
831	my advice to you-- figure out what line you aren't willing to cross for him.	2
832	that's an insult to everything teen prostitutes have worked for.	2
833	what if i just go into protective custody, spend the next three days in the hole?	2
834	this is what you said you wanted, but you're actually more upset now that her husband knows.	2
835	plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you.	2
836	i wasn't convinced until simpson failed three times.	2
837	you said, blah blah blah blah blah, deaf ears, blah blah blah blah blah.	2
838	you're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.	2
839	14-year-old girl, intermittent attacks.	2
840	it's extreme and reckless.	2
841	drew wasn't deaf! house.	2
842	gotcha! you poor dumb bastard.	2
843	and i suspect that you've spent every minute since this has happened trying to answer that very question.	2
844	not only was there a gut tuck, nose tuck, and arse tuck, but her new, fake norks stick out like nuts on a mutt.	2
845	what, so i can get busted by social services?	2
846	could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.	2
847	i knew this would fall on deaf ears, but i just kept talking and talking.	2
848	you saved a man's life.	2
849	dull people get cancer too.	2
850	i'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced adams has parentally inflicted damage.	2
851	you thought it was insane, and yet you let it happen.	2
852	i'm actually concerned it might be because of the change in management.	2
853	and on a personal note, if my actions caused anyone distress, i sincerely apologize.	2
854	hiv-related mononeuritis multiplex.	2
855	not as far as our lawyers are concerned.	2
856	they're willing to come back.	2
857	i hear one of you thinks i'm a real bastard.	2
858	which gets processed with a heavy metal called antimony.	2
859	you saved my life too.	2
860	his liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels.	2
861	could be transient nitrogen load from a g.i. bleed.	2
862	it could be a bladder infection.	2
863	you may remember me from the time i saved your life.	2
864	i'm not gonna let you blackmail me, house.	2
865	the rivets go pop, i slide in the heating pad.	2
866	it stumped two e.r. docs and an immunologist from johns hopkins.	2
867	we need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.	2
868	abdominal ultrasound was negative.	2
869	i'm not allergic to wheat.	2
870	he ate a bag of peanuts, and peanut proteins would be.	2
871	but you do know i just can't let this slide.	2
872	you haven't gotten two consecutive minutes without using the word loyalty, which explains the anger and the low self-esteem, and the desire to feel pretty.	2
873	so you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?	2
874	which one of you is the cheap bastard?	2
875	stumped three internists and a department chair from harvard.	2
876	confirm that we did major abdominal surgery on him and then completely forgot about it.	2
877	he saved my husband's life.	2
878	hepatic encephalopathy explained why he passed out, why he couldn't move his limbs.	2
879	the gun slipped and-- i only had blanks in it, but.	2
880	and chase being cagey in general.	2
881	can't you see she's upset?	2
882	his body temperature is rising.	2
883	i need to be taken into protective custody.	2
884	busting a move in a night club.	2
885	we could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal.	2
886	glad to see taking a year off didn't dull your skill set.	2
887	blood work was negative for hiv.	2
888	you can't if you're not willing-- just take care of yourself.	2
889	how 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?	2
890	and mom's a selfish jerk.	2
891	because it's the one place you're unable to indulge your self-destructive habits.	2
892	because you realize they're not dull.	2
893	foreman will find out you're taking this case, and he'll bust you.	2
894	because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a severe anatomical disadvantage.	2
895	wilson my ass! i told you to leave him alone, you son of a bitch! temper trigger.	2
896	i've been eating wheat my entire life.	2
897	nobody's here to bust you, iris.	2
898	my theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.	2
899	you were cagey about where you were going.	2
900	but when that six-year-old heckler punched him in his juggling pins, it kicked up the dormant bacteria in his pelvis.	2
901	i think i might have said insane.	2
902	thanks to your generous donation, you have all morning.	2
903	it's temperature that sets it off, not force.	2
904	if you weren't wrestling with this, i'd say there's something really wrong with you.	2
905	but right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.	2
906	discharge the patient.	2
907	complexes of large, y-shaped antibodies were clogging up your blood vessels, causing your organs to shut down one by one.	2
908	his heartbeat's doing well, and his body temperature is stabilized.	2
909	and i need a transplant, and they say i don't have much time, so when i heard that you were willing, i just.	2
910	maybe a dive in volleyball practice or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen.	2
911	taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.	2
912	that seems like an overreaction.	2
913	his mental status is declining.	2
914	something happened that you were upset about?	2
915	that last insult was your cue to leave.	2
916	nothing wrong except a common bladder infection.	2
917	it'll raise his temperature enough that his heart should naturally start.	2
918	saving us both from contraband charges.	2
919	the guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk.	2
920	after you'd administered the heparin, i see there was a discharge order on the chart, and yet the patient never left.	2
921	it's the neurochemical basis for bonding.	2
922	it's the silence, the contemplation, the order.	1
923	he's puking his guts out.	1
924	no one joins the clergy without having that epiphany.	1
925	and then go back to sneaking around behind his back?	1
926	would you please read the caption under the photo?	1
927	probably not contagious at this point.	1
928	no, you're right-- i really should roll the dice and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life the way that my mom-- get your hands off my stuff! the stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.	1
929	but what about compromising it in a minor way?	1
930	please accept this on behalf of all of us and know that we love you.	1
931	oh, and that was checkmate, right?	1
932	his neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.	1
933	meatloaf, potatoes, coffee.	1
934	and your collective vomiting.	1
935	i'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.	1
936	they always get perky when you're being painfully earnest.	1
937	there's a little mass here, and i'd like to get it checked out.	1
938	check out our new brand, huh?	1
939	sticking around the whole time?	1
940	the test will monitor its rhythm so we can check foany abnormalities.	1
941	i'm not sloppy seconds.	1
942	i'm gonna need number three vicryls.	1
943	because the patient was unconscious.	1
944	bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus.	1
945	45-year-old truck driver, recurrent seizures.	1
946	you reassess your life when you've made mistakes.	1
947	saline flow is down to 10 ccs.	1
948	it can make you very, very late for very important dates.	1
949	still there's only one way to settle this.	1
950	check his tsh levels and get a sleep study.	1
951	it's just a benign fat deposit.	1
952	weak blood vessel in the brain gets pounded on by elevated bp, causes it to expand and contract.	1
953	you know that close to 1% of the population identifies as asexual?	1
954	yes, please come back, and we'll get you started.	1
955	well, that very evolved of you.	1
956	you--you meddle and force me into impossible situations.	1
957	we had to stop the transfusion.	1
958	asthma-induced pneumothorax would and might not show up on a posteroanterior x-ray.	1
959	i thought for sure there'd be some yelling or profanity, possible bloodletting.	1
960	those scars on my ass you may have noticed.	1
961	probably got a kit stashed here.	1
962	and only you have dimples, which are adorable, but they're also an x-linked dominant genetic trait.	1
963	he makes them feel like he's helping by offering a plea or even just by letting them pay their debt and clear their conscience.	1
964	i've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.	1
965	please stop calling me.	1
966	are you checking up on me or on house?	1
967	i've thought about it, but i'd probably end up shooting someone in my own family, like when my brother tosses his toenail clippings behind the couch.	1
968	i spent half my time changing diapers and the other half cleaning up my mom's vomit.	1
969	patient had v-tach in the echo lab, so we capped him, but.	1
970	wednesday, 2:43 p.m. , a black pawn will believe he's the black king and attempt to capture the.	1
971	and check with admitting for the net worth of all new patients.	1
972	you need to check this out.	1
973	you're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes ?	1
974	you can't be embarrassed about a manicure.	1
975	please read the highlighted text at the bottom of the page.	1
976	i specifically requested my wakeup startle three hours from now.	1
977	myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.	1
978	this check is for significantly more than what i told you it would take to fund the department.	1
979	you don't like that i'm reassessing my life, that i want to change it, that i can.	1
980	maybe i should just accept the patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.	1
981	rain check, i promise.	1
982	another dozen getting teargas hosed off them.	1
983	it says that you're healthy, you're going back to work, and you're signing the lease that officially moves the company to china.	1
984	it's been a pleasure having you in the neighborhood.	1
985	you sexually molested your son.	1
986	if you ever hear me mention anything about wanting kids, please feel free to punch me in the liver.	1
987	otherwise, he could be accused of caring.	1
988	he's having a seizure.	1
989	number three went to a baseball game the day before he donated.	1
990	you know, there are platitudes that can help you with that.	1
991	we can do a lumbar puncture to confirm.	1
992	goes to the witness's credibility.	1
993	i'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.	1
994	and you're here in my heart like when i gave you that necklace that you just dumped in the ocean.	1
995	more curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?	1
996	we would have had to biopsy his lymph nodes anyway to check for cancer.	1
997	he caught me with her, got me with a rake.	1
998	no, it was just something i'd been thinking about and i figured, what the heck?	1
999	or it's your family, some kind of immigrant pride thing.	1
1000	would you read it, please?	1
1001	or something is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree.	1
1002	i consider these grounds to be a holy place, and i would ask you to observe them with due decorum.	1
1003	vomiting stopped after the e.	1
1004	right, like group homes, where you're packed in with as many messed-up delinquent kids as possible, foster parents who only take you in because you're a meal ticket.	1
1005	you're stepping to a guy who outweighs you by 50 pounds, and he was carrying a cane, which, while prison-approved, would still cause some issues if inserted into your colon.	1
1006	just when they're beginning to, uh.	1
1007	not quite sure what box to check here.	1
1008	he wandered out of the sandbox into the street, into the path of a moving car.	1
1009	i think it should give you solace, help you to move on.	1
1010	check out the video again.	1
1011	we're just gonna cut your earlobe a bit and check back in two minutes.	1
1012	you wanted me to meddle.	1
1013	judge's order for your immediate release.	1
1014	we've always relied on our tribes to keep us safe.	1
1015	saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.	1
1016	i don't care how sick your spouse gets, you don't jump ship.	1
1017	he's confident in the diagnosis.	1
1018	but not his swollen lymph notes.	1
1019	please don't fire me.	1
1020	he thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.	1
1021	it's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.	1
1022	now, if you'll excuse me, i ha to go slaughter a fatted calf for lunch.	1
1023	i am a cripple in need of assistance.	1
1024	pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population.	1
1025	he's moving it out of grief.	1
1026	why don't you check his vaccination record before you make another stupid.	1
1027	encephalitis makes his brain swell, which causes symptoms that are hard to distinguish from his alzheimer's.	1
1028	foreman, would you please reach under your chair?	1
1029	please, you have to help me solve this thing.	1
1030	cauterized the ulcer, stopped the bleeding.	1
1031	they decided that your being stabbed.	1
1032	ugh! we hear you're gonna need an incentive to get all my pills by tomorrow.	1
1033	the bleeding is in her gut.	1
1034	and the pericardial inflammation.	1
1035	but i need to see down your barrel.	1
1036	shut up, you lying sack of crap.	1
1037	please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.	1
1038	no, i'm just saying what he's doing doesn't seem rational, which makes me think it's rational in a way i'm not privy to.	1
1039	endoscopy didn't reveal any lesions in the small intestine.	1
1040	park's tiger mom and dad were so insufferable, she has to measure their affection in hours.	1
1041	might not be a coincidence that the pain started on the verge of a major life change.	1
1042	you just got stabbed.	1
1043	i know this is hard, but please tell me exactly what happened next.	1
1044	i'm not done testifying.	1
1045	i have prosecuted hundreds of despicable acts by husbands, wives, parents.	1
1046	please, um, it's okay.	1
1047	dr.park, would you please reach under that chair?	1
1048	she has jaw claudication.	1
1049	you're a moron and a coward.	1
1050	it explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.	1
1051	patriotism is nothing but loyalty to real estate, real estate that's been conquered 800 times by 800 different regimes with 800 different cultures.	1
1052	i've got only two years left in my stretch.	1
1053	or they love you too much, so you need to prove your humility.	1
1054	but he's not in prison, and it's kind of hard to gas a guy unless you can seal him in a room first.	1
1055	he lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.	1
1056	you think you should kill yourself if you become a burden to the people who love you?	1
1057	your colleague was stabbed.	1
1058	explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.	1
1059	much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.	1
1060	i've seen how you disrespect those patients.	1
1061	his sclera's jaundiced.	1
1062	so they'll never testify against me.	1
1063	first patriotism, now loyalty.	1
1064	he wanted to check on me.	1
1065	take him off antiemetics, do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds.	1
1066	it's your choice to make house a useful tool or a monkey wrench.	1
1067	you're gonna have to talk to my bankruptcy attorney.	1
1068	but this mold definitely is.	1
1069	i know, one gospel says passover, another says the day before.	1
1070	there's an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery of his brain.	1
1071	checked the anesthesia sheet, pressure was fine throughout.	1
1072	not if the vomiting's persistent.	1
1073	if you're just looking to amuse yourself at my expense, then no.	1
1074	the new dean of medicine has an ethical obligation to come in with a completely open mind about all employees, thus letting me blithely run roughshod for at least four weeks.	1
1075	his trachea wasn't swollen.	1
1076	show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.	1
1077	it's a press release.	1
1078	please just let me get out of here.	1
1079	great ideas, if dengue fever or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly.	1
1080	i'm staining for excess iron.	1
1081	look what happened with london and the riots.	1
1082	the jealous wife in the dining room with bipyridyl herbicide.	1
1083	awkward! he knocked up two different women at the same time.	1
1084	we've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.	1
1085	we should biopsy the skin lesion and start him on enoxaparin.	1
1086	no signs of ulcers or blockages.	1
1087	a life of perpetual enclosure and almost complete silence?	1
1088	you're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.	1
1089	he was getting revenge for the orange hair and rigged it in house's office.	1
1090	i've always dreamed of living in an abandoned house with mold.	1
1091	one day, i was writing a check to my landscaper, and it suddenly hit me-- $6,000 to take out plants and put in different plants.	1
1092	move your cane, please.	1
1093	acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.	1
1094	saline's flushing it forward but getting no return.	1
1095	the patient was punched in the groin.	1
1096	to put it another way, a patriot.	1
1097	get out of my office, please.	1
1098	cuddy dark will waste his afternoon chasing conspiracy theories.	1
1099	if the plumbing's fine, check the electrical.	1
1100	must be such a pleasure to live in your head.	1
1101	been in and out of rehab, ve up clowning.	1
1102	well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if i wanna check the returns policy.	1
1103	she said when her mom slips again, she didn't want to be there.	1
1104	no, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after i shot down the first one.	1
1105	please be respectful.	1
1106	we're not gonna tell him he was molested?	1
1107	i'll go check on the patient.	1
1108	the guy's potassium is off.	1
1109	cold fingers and toes?	1
1110	if she likes crippled guys, i'm free for the next six minutes.	1
1111	please tell me if you hear anything.	1
1112	tommy's the most popular guy in his office.	1
1113	i just needed to create a distraction, though.	1
1114	i'm beginning to think we should just go with house's idea.	1
1115	four-year-old boy, consistently at death's door.	1
1116	you could probably just hide the porn in your underwear drawer.	1
1117	i'm more clever and more devious.	1
1118	her home number is-- normal complement studies.	1
1119	taub is interrogating the janitor.	1
1120	i was stabbed by a patient.	1
1121	then you have creepy neighbors, because there were photos of you and your kids all over.	1
1122	schizophrenia doesn't cause skin ulcers or fevers.	1
1123	i think you're right about the strep.	1
1124	flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an ekg.	1
1125	john woo movies, romance novels, kale.	1
1126	taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics he is a coward, who's better off running and hiding at the first sign of danger.	1
1127	whereas you just dabble in crazy.	1
1128	and that's from a guy with one alimony and two child support payments.	1
1129	since claudine left, no one's been inputting the numbers.	1
1130	i asked him to meet me here for a family reunion.	1
1131	sex releases oxytocin.	1
1132	there's a difference between an isolated riot and the fall of civilization.	1
1133	you think my judgment's the least bit compromised?	1
1134	the transplant team will meet you there with updates from the past two hours.	1
1135	release the best actors?	1
1136	could be coxsackie b virus.	1
1137	the legendary night on which we watch santos shatter rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.	1
1138	dr.adams, would you please reach into my pants?	1
1139	his vision's back to normal, and if he remains asymptomatic through the night, we'll be able to release him in the morning.	1
1140	we think we've dealt wit all the liability issues.	1
1141	his body's flooded with an excess of phosphates, potassium, acids, all kinds of cancerous junk.	1
1142	if the latter was prone to violence, you'd have been scattered in various dumpsters years ago.	1
1143	this thing's attacking your bones, your joints, your blood.	1
1144	when his seizure occurred.	1
1145	will you please just go away?	1
1146	we'll check catecholamines for pheo and run an expanded opioid panel.	1
1147	they only come out when you're afraid or anxious.	1
1148	yeah, i use booze as payment.	1
1149	your friend got stabbed.	1
1150	you can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.	1
1151	your judgment's compromised.	1
1152	he started vomiting again.	1
1153	you weren't trying to undermine my confidence, you were trying to inflate it.	1
1154	doesn't explain why he vomited so hard he ripped his insides.	1
1155	we really gotta get you laid.	1
1156	you're completely normal and a pleasure to deal with.	1
1157	pop! is that supposed to be funny?	1
1158	but i've never seen you use rosary beads.	1
1159	so you want twice as many of them disrespected?	1
1160	you and park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.	1
1161	i'm not interested in another department's sloppy seconds.	1
1162	no, chirping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.	1
1163	scam extra vicodin, back to jail.	1
1164	might be, if these were actually cheetos' stains.	1
1165	getting you out of jail was not a popular decision with the board.	1
1166	if it was gad, he'd be having seizures.	1
1167	the fact is, winning $100 from you gives me more pleasure than winning $100 from her.	1
1168	i-i checked online, and it's.	1
1169	mini-mental, ct, and get a hair sample to check for past cocaine use.	1
1170	animals use the canal as a potty, the eggs from the feces ended up in callie's intestines when she went swimming.	1
1171	so maybe a solvent or detergent?	1
1172	and check chase for testosterone.	1
1173	patriotism is natural.	1
1174	you have late-stage syphilis, which you gave to our patient presumably 12 years ago, which also explains why mom is not big on family reunions.	1
1175	i say we put him out of his misery and bring out emma's cake.	1
1176	complete recruitment and interference pattern.	1
